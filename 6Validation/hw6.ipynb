Information transfer in libraries is\\nrestricted to the use of documents.

The library acts as a channel in only a\\nproportion of the situations in which information is\\ntransferred.\\nTaking technical information transfer as a whole,\\nthere is no doubt that this proportion is not the\\nmajor one.  There are users of technical information -\\nparticularly in technology rather than science -\\nwho visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk\\ncollections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal\\ncontact with their colleagues and with people in other\\norganizations.

Bibliographical\\ncontrol is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power,\\nas the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense\\npower over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written\\nform.

In more recent times, these games have\\nbecome more and more sophisticated, and many now use large\\nelectronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.\\nSince 1956, when the first well-developed management game was\\nintroduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety\\nof disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education,\\nfrom primary school classes to courses for experienced professional\\nmen and women.  One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\"\\nhas been the rapid development of sophisticated management\\ntechniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which\\nhave been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.\\n.X\\n4\\t2\\t5\\n5\\t6\\t5\\n90\\t1\\t5\\n91\\t1\\t5\\n115\\t1\\t5\\n158\\t1\\t5\\n207\\t1\\t5\\n222\\t1\\t5\\n223\\t1\\t5\\n234\\t1\\t5\\n245\\t2\\t5\\n364\\t2\\t5\\n365\\t1\\t5\\n368\\t1\\t5\\n435\\t1\\t5\\n535\\t1\\t5\\n553\\t1\\t5\\n598\\t1\\t5\\n615\\t1\\t5\\n764\\t1\\t5\\n766\\t1\\t5\\n811\\t2\\t5\\n815\\t1\\t5\\n816\\t2\\t5\\n818\\t1\\t5\\n823\\t1\\t5\\n842\\t1\\t5\\n915\\t1\\t5\\n925\\t2\\t5\\n944\\t1\\t5\\n948\\t1\\t5\\n957\\t1\\t5\\n959\\t1\\t5\\n960\\t1\\t5\\n961\\t2\\t5\\n962\\t1\\t5\\n964\\t1\\t5\\n1023\\t2\\t5\\n1219\\t1\\t5\\n1227\\t1\\t5\\n1257\\t1\\t5\\n1365\\t1\\t5\\n1390\\t1\\t5\\n1400\\t1\\t5\\n1400\\t1\\t5\\n.I 6\\n.T\\nAbstracting Concepts and Methods\\n.A\\nBorko, H.\\n.W\\n     Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a \\nhow-to-do-it course.\\nIt should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts,\\nthe historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing\\nindustry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the\\npreparation and evaluation of the product.\\nThese topics we call concepts.\\n     The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing\\nvarious types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications.\\nThese detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the\\nappendix.\\nThere is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.\\n     Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we\\nbelieve that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the\\npast.\\nComputer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship.\\nMuch research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of\\ncomputer-prepared abstracts and extracts.\\nStudents, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this\\nresearch and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text,\\nselect key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts.\\nThe benefits of this research are discussed.\\n    Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry.\\nOpportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or\\nvolunteer workers.\\nMany librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know\\nthey are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.\\nOne chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.\\n.X\\n6\\t6\\t6\\n363\\t1\\t6\\n403\\t1\\t6\\n461\\t1\\t6\\n551\\t1\\t6\\n551\\t1\\t6\\n.I 7\\n.T\\nAcademic Library Buildings\\nA Guide to Architectural Issues and Solutions\\n.A\\nEllsworth, R.E.\\n.W\\nThis book attempts to present representative examples of successful\\narchitectural solutions to the important problems librarians and\\narchitects face in planning new college and university library\\nbuildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.

Lyle\\n.A\\nFarber, E.I.\\n.W\\n     As important for staff members\\' individual development\\nas was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most\\nsignificant attitude one acquired while working for\\nGuy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must\\nbe interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the\\nmaterials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his\\nrespect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and\\nreading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in\\nhis admonition that, though we were primarily a research\\nlibrary, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to\\ncollect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It\\nwas primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be\\nresponsible for these as well as for \"general\" books which crossed\\ndisciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books\\nwhich a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is\\napt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection,\\n\"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with\\nbooks through a reading of critical reviews and the books\\nthemselves.\"  This counsel is from The President, the Professor,\\nand the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the\\nneed to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was\\ncontinually impressed upon us.\\n.X\\n8\\t5\\t8\\n20\\t1\\t8\\n171\\t1\\t8\\n909\\t1\\t8\\n918\\t1\\t8\\n1061\\t1\\t8\\n1453\\t1\\t8\\n1453\\t1\\t8\\n.I 9\\n.T\\nAccess to Libraries in College\\n.A\\nHyman, R.T.\\n.W\\n     This study assumed that an additional use study held\\nless promise than an analytical consideration of concepts.\\nThe basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and\\ncurrent professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering\\ninstruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire.\\n     Findings of the documentary analysis included the following:\\n     Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach\\nand browsing left the problems largely unresolved and\\nevidently resistant to established methods of use and user\\nresearch.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was\\nconfirmed.\\n     Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification\\nand relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual,\\nsocial, and political interest of the average citizen and affect\\nhis democratic self-realization.\\n     Definitions of \"browsing\" varied greatly: self-indulgence\\nby the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education\\nfor the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his\\nresearch.\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t9\\n9\\t5\\t9\\n32\\t1\\t9\\n96\\t1\\t9\\n137\\t1\\t9\\n163\\t1\\t9\\n207\\t2\\t9\\n222\\t1\\t9\\n223\\t1\\t9\\n296\\t1\\t9\\n297\\t1\\t9\\n298\\t1\\t9\\n300\\t1\\t9\\n301\\t1\\t9\\n302\\t1\\t9\\n358\\t1\\t9\\n364\\t1\\t9\\n456\\t1\\t9\\n515\\t1\\t9\\n535\\t1\\t9\\n625\\t1\\t9\\n629\\t1\\t9\\n631\\t1\\t9\\n634\\t1\\t9\\n768\\t1\\t9\\n774\\t1\\t9\\n783\\t1\\t9\\n791\\t1\\t9\\n799\\t1\\t9\\n811\\t2\\t9\\n816\\t2\\t9\\n818\\t1\\t9\\n823\\t1\\t9\\n843\\t1\\t9\\n844\\t1\\t9\\n846\\t1\\t9\\n913\\t1\\t9\\n915\\t1\\t9\\n961\\t2\\t9\\n962\\t2\\t9\\n964\\t2\\t9\\n968\\t1\\t9\\n994\\t1\\t9\\n1015\\t1\\t9\\n1068\\t1\\t9\\n1203\\t1\\t9\\n1242\\t1\\t9\\n1247\\t1\\t9\\n1268\\t1\\t9\\n1321\\t1\\t9\\n1354\\t1\\t9\\n1407\\t1\\t9\\n1445\\t1\\t9\\n1445\\t1\\t9\\n.I 10\\n.T\\nAccess to Periodical Resources\\n.A\\nPalmour, V.E.\\n.W\\n          The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate,\\nand recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical\\nresources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans\\nare for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being\\nsatisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in\\nthe long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is\\nthe possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring,\\nstoring, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials.\\n          This study focused on the physical access to the\\nperiodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community,\\ndesign features were developed, and included the following:\\n          Service should be made available to all users\\n          without any restriction other than access\\n          through a library.\\n          Initially, the service should be confined primarily\\n          to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of\\n          journal articles.\\n          The collection of a center should be comprehensive\\n          in subject coverage excluding only medicine.\\n          All worthwhile journals should be collected\\n          irrespective of language.\\n.X\\n10\\t12\\t10\\n145\\t1\\t10\\n167\\t1\\t10\\n190\\t1\\t10\\n225\\t1\\t10\\n232\\t1\\t10\\n244\\t1\\t10\\n304\\t1\\t10\\n305\\t1\\t10\\n306\\t1\\t10\\n358\\t1\\t10\\n385\\t1\\t10\\n394\\t1\\t10\\n400\\t1\\t10\\n433\\t1\\t10\\n459\\t1\\t10\\n534\\t1\\t10\\n541\\t1\\t10\\n551\\t2\\t10\\n702\\t1\\t10\\n731\\t1\\t10\\n732\\t1\\t10\\n788\\t1\\t10\\n817\\t1\\t10\\n820\\t1\\t10\\n823\\t1\\t10\\n825\\t1\\t10\\n826\\t1\\t10\\n827\\t1\\t10\\n828\\t1\\t10\\n831\\t1\\t10\\n881\\t1\\t10\\n886\\t1\\t10\\n887\\t1\\t10\\n919\\t1\\t10\\n920\\t1\\t10\\n921\\t1\\t10\\n942\\t1\\t10\\n947\\t2\\t10\\n948\\t1\\t10\\n1017\\t1\\t10\\n1058\\t2\\t10\\n1059\\t1\\t10\\n1060\\t1\\t10\\n1146\\t1\\t10\\n1227\\t1\\t10\\n1230\\t1\\t10\\n1257\\t1\\t10\\n1258\\t2\\t10\\n1302\\t1\\t10\\n1305\\t1\\t10\\n1306\\t1\\t10\\n1390\\t6\\t10\\n1390\\t6\\t10\\n.I 11\\n.T\\nThe Acquisition of Library Materials\\n.A\\nFord, S.\\n.W\\n  The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction,\\nacknowledges the importance of selection policy,\\nserials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions.\\nThese topics are discussed in this book only as they relate\\nto obtaining library materials.

The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of\\nacquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for\\nreference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre\\nfor the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision\\nof bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be\\na basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications\\nfrom those areas.

The college library exists, not merely to house and\\ncirculate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching\\nprocess with reference service, to afford faculty members library\\nopportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students\\nto read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a\\nservice activity, a tool through which library functions are more\\nfully and efficiently realized.\\n  The present work retains most of the material of the first edition,\\nbut includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was\\nplanned not only as a text in the teaching of college library\\nadministration but also for independent professional reading.  Because\\nreaders have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful\\nfor reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in\\nsome cases extended.\\n.X\\n14\\t6\\t14\\n132\\t1\\t14\\n137\\t1\\t14\\n153\\t1\\t14\\n170\\t1\\t14\\n223\\t1\\t14\\n237\\t1\\t14\\n266\\t1\\t14\\n271\\t1\\t14\\n272\\t1\\t14\\n302\\t1\\t14\\n550\\t1\\t14\\n767\\t1\\t14\\n772\\t1\\t14\\n952\\t1\\t14\\n1019\\t1\\t14\\n1028\\t1\\t14\\n1030\\t1\\t14\\n1086\\t1\\t14\\n1090\\t1\\t14\\n1275\\t1\\t14\\n1280\\t1\\t14\\n1424\\t3\\t14\\n1424\\t3\\t14\\n.I 15\\n.T\\nInformation Flow in Research and Development Laboratories\\n.A\\nAllen, Thomas J.\\nCohen, Stephen I.\\n.W\\n   Technical communication patterns in two research and development laboratories\\nwere examined using modified sociometric techniques..

Most of the text\\ndeals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the\\npreparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which\\nare essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable\\nattention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC\\nClassification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In\\naddition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most\\nfrequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been\\nthoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of\\ncomprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of\\ncatalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users,\\na chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying\\nmachines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography\\nof books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is\\nincluded for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the\\ntortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized\\ncataloging and classification.

To put the\\ndifference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises\\nthe methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in\\nEconomics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising\\nparameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language\\nstructure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and\\nmethods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author\\'s \"Language as\\nchoice and Chance\", 1956, has now taken definite shape.\\n  Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book,\\n\"Language as Choice and Chance\", the foundation was laid for a truly\\nsensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation\\nof the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical\\nuniverse and sample.\\n.X\\n19\\t7\\t19\\n37\\t1\\t19\\n39\\t1\\t19\\n40\\t1\\t19\\n44\\t1\\t19\\n47\\t1\\t19\\n88\\t1\\t19\\n97\\t1\\t19\\n102\\t1\\t19\\n103\\t1\\t19\\n228\\t2\\t19\\n229\\t1\\t19\\n233\\t1\\t19\\n253\\t1\\t19\\n313\\t1\\t19\\n318\\t1\\t19\\n321\\t2\\t19\\n324\\t1\\t19\\n329\\t2\\t19\\n359\\t1\\t19\\n377\\t1\\t19\\n379\\t1\\t19\\n395\\t1\\t19\\n416\\t2\\t19\\n441\\t1\\t19\\n442\\t1\\t19\\n450\\t1\\t19\\n495\\t1\\t19\\n505\\t1\\t19\\n511\\t1\\t19\\n521\\t1\\t19\\n524\\t1\\t19\\n560\\t1\\t19\\n563\\t1\\t19\\n565\\t1\\t19\\n567\\t1\\t19\\n573\\t1\\t19\\n592\\t1\\t19\\n618\\t1\\t19\\n632\\t1\\t19\\n635\\t1\\t19\\n667\\t1\\t19\\n700\\t1\\t19\\n748\\t1\\t19\\n749\\t1\\t19\\n751\\t1\\t19\\n764\\t1\\t19\\n765\\t1\\t19\\n777\\t1\\t19\\n778\\t1\\t19\\n782\\t1\\t19\\n791\\t1\\t19\\n804\\t1\\t19\\n805\\t1\\t19\\n835\\t1\\t19\\n851\\t1\\t19\\n862\\t1\\t19\\n875\\t1\\t19\\n893\\t1\\t19\\n952\\t1\\t19\\n1016\\t1\\t19\\n1061\\t1\\t19\\n1085\\t1\\t19\\n1086\\t1\\t19\\n1087\\t1\\t19\\n1182\\t1\\t19\\n1194\\t1\\t19\\n1199\\t2\\t19\\n1200\\t1\\t19\\n1274\\t1\\t19\\n1277\\t1\\t19\\n1278\\t1\\t19\\n1280\\t1\\t19\\n1287\\t1\\t19\\n1301\\t1\\t19\\n1302\\t1\\t19\\n1304\\t1\\t19\\n1313\\t1\\t19\\n1338\\t1\\t19\\n1344\\t1\\t19\\n1347\\t1\\t19\\n1380\\t1\\t19\\n1428\\t1\\t19\\n1444\\t1\\t19\\n1444\\t1\\t19\\n.I 20\\n.T\\nThe Age of Jewett: Charles Coffin Jewett and American Librarianship\\n1841-1868\\n.A\\nHarris, M.M.\\n.W\\n     Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship\\nfrom the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and\\nthe appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and\\ncontroversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter.\\n     But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in\\nthe history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the\\n1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances\\nin the field of American librarianship.

This, be it noted, is most evident in\\nfiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack\\nis virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting\\nis necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially\\npeaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often\\nfatal attacks on the weaker mate.\\n  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in\\nthe human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and\\nnot guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the\\naggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.\\nMan has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,\\nmany of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in\\nanimals.

Its purpose is \\nto generate discussion that will lead\\neventually to a statement of Association policy\\nthat the profession will support and make\\neffective.\\n  A basic assumption on which the statement\\nrests is this: that the library occupation is\\nmuch broader than that segment of it which is\\nthe library profession, but that the professional\\nsegment has responsibility for the definition\\nand supervision of the training and education\\nrequired by the complete range of activities\\nencompassed by the occupation.  Librarians\\nare not the only persons who work in\\nlibraries, but librarians are the ones who are\\nconcerned with the advancement and improvement\\nof the library profession.  It follows then\\nthat it is the obligation of the professionals\\nto engage actively in the establishment and\\nmaintenance of standards and norms governing\\nthe preparation of people who work at\\nany level in libraries.

However up until the forties the overwhelming\\nmajority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic\\nstructures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first\\ngeneral theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary\\noperations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.\\nTarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic\\nprinciples of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such\\nsets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made\\nabundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of\\nmaking fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but\\nalso the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was\\ndiscovered by the author in 1936.\\n  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the\\ntheory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately\\nrelated despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And\\nit is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems\\ndealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and\\nrelations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the\\nlanguage of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can\\nbe considered to border on logic and algebra.\\n.X\\n25\\t7\\t25\\n455\\t1\\t25\\n1117\\t3\\t25\\n1118\\t1\\t25\\n1119\\t2\\t25\\n1133\\t1\\t25\\n1137\\t1\\t25\\n1140\\t1\\t25\\n1141\\t1\\t25\\n1224\\t1\\t25\\n1409\\t1\\t25\\n1409\\t1\\t25\\n.I 26\\n.T\\nIndexing and Abstracting by Association\\n.A\\nDoyle, L.B.\\n.W\\nThis article discusses the possibility of exploiting the\\nstatistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of\\ndocument retrieval.

The\\nprogram has been used for the analysis of several\\nlarge systems and has proven itself to be a useful\\nresearch tool for the study of systems with so many\\ncomponents and interrelated operations that an\\nequivalent manual analysis would be extremely\\ncumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even\\nimpractical.

Thus, we will find\\nin the literature both a frankly subjective notion of \\nrelevance as reported by individual users, and equations,\\ncurves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide\\nnumerical measures of the recall and relevance\\ncharacteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon\\nof shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective\\nand non-mathematical term to equations in which the\\nsame term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical\\ndefinition has its ancient parallel in discussions\\nof probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the\\nmeaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,\\non \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand,\\nthe use of a single term in the same document to cover\\ntwo or more distinct meanings, especially when such a\\nusage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine\\nby attributing to it mathematical validity which it does\\nnot have, represents a more serious situation than merely\\ncareless ambiguity.\\n.X\\n28\\t5\\t28\\n42\\t1\\t28\\n43\\t1\\t28\\n45\\t1\\t28\\n72\\t1\\t28\\n79\\t1\\t28\\n133\\t1\\t28\\n134\\t1\\t28\\n157\\t1\\t28\\n381\\t1\\t28\\n389\\t1\\t28\\n390\\t1\\t28\\n468\\t1\\t28\\n486\\t2\\t28\\n487\\t1\\t28\\n514\\t1\\t28\\n518\\t1\\t28\\n564\\t1\\t28\\n565\\t2\\t28\\n595\\t1\\t28\\n615\\t1\\t28\\n646\\t1\\t28\\n661\\t1\\t28\\n663\\t1\\t28\\n714\\t1\\t28\\n752\\t1\\t28\\n785\\t1\\t28\\n820\\t1\\t28\\n822\\t1\\t28\\n827\\t1\\t28\\n829\\t1\\t28\\n853\\t1\\t28\\n895\\t1\\t28\\n1091\\t1\\t28\\n1282\\t1\\t28\\n1282\\t1\\t28\\n.I 29\\n.T\\nSome Questions Concerning \"Information Need\"\\n.A\\nO\\'Connor, J.\\n.W\\nThe expression \"satisfying a requester\\'s information\\nneed\" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.

In order to consider the later problem, the question \\nof concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of\\nconcept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is \\nassociated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users\\' similarity-\\njudgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and\\nconceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general \\ndifficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their \\nrelatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human \\nrelevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has\\nserious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is \\ntherefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article..\\n.X\\n3\\t1\\t42\\n20\\t1\\t42\\n28\\t1\\t42\\n29\\t1\\t42\\n35\\t2\\t42\\n42\\t7\\t42\\n43\\t2\\t42\\n52\\t1\\t42\\n58\\t1\\t42\\n60\\t1\\t42\\n70\\t2\\t42\\n72\\t1\\t42\\n73\\t1\\t42\\n79\\t1\\t42\\n81\\t1\\t42\\n84\\t1\\t42\\n85\\t1\\t42\\n95\\t1\\t42\\n129\\t1\\t42\\n152\\t1\\t42\\n172\\t1\\t42\\n184\\t1\\t42\\n193\\t1\\t42\\n202\\t1\\t42\\n420\\t1\\t42\\n444\\t2\\t42\\n445\\t1\\t42\\n447\\t1\\t42\\n449\\t1\\t42\\n469\\t1\\t42\\n474\\t1\\t42\\n486\\t1\\t42\\n532\\t1\\t42\\n564\\t1\\t42\\n565\\t1\\t42\\n578\\t1\\t42\\n582\\t1\\t42\\n585\\t1\\t42\\n589\\t1\\t42\\n594\\t1\\t42\\n595\\t1\\t42\\n599\\t1\\t42\\n625\\t1\\t42\\n640\\t1\\t42\\n652\\t1\\t42\\n655\\t1\\t42\\n656\\t1\\t42\\n657\\t1\\t42\\n660\\t1\\t42\\n661\\t1\\t42\\n663\\t1\\t42\\n665\\t1\\t42\\n714\\t2\\t42\\n761\\t1\\t42\\n762\\t3\\t42\\n764\\t1\\t42\\n803\\t1\\t42\\n893\\t1\\t42\\n907\\t1\\t42\\n1016\\t1\\t42\\n1022\\t1\\t42\\n1030\\t1\\t42\\n1045\\t2\\t42\\n1054\\t1\\t42\\n1084\\t1\\t42\\n1154\\t1\\t42\\n1195\\t1\\t42\\n1201\\t1\\t42\\n1232\\t1\\t42\\n1235\\t1\\t42\\n1268\\t1\\t42\\n1281\\t2\\t42\\n1285\\t1\\t42\\n1295\\t1\\t42\\n1298\\t1\\t42\\n1394\\t1\\t42\\n1407\\t1\\t42\\n1407\\t1\\t42\\n.I 43\\n.T\\nThe Consistency of Human Judgments of Relevance\\n.A\\nResnick, A.\\n.A\\nSavage, T.R.\\n.W\\n   A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance \\nof documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, \\nkeywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. \\nThe results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently,\\nand 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base \\nfrom which it is made..

The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user \\ncirculation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design,\\nsatisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of\\nminimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates \\nthat the number of volumes in a library\\'s holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 \\npercent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may\\nalso be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order\\nthat user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this \\napproach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the \\nlibrary\\'s holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the \\ndisappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of \\nuse by another..\\n.X\\n31\\t3\\t46\\n33\\t1\\t46\\n36\\t2\\t46\\n41\\t1\\t46\\n46\\t14\\t46\\n115\\t1\\t46\\n181\\t1\\t46\\n182\\t1\\t46\\n183\\t1\\t46\\n184\\t1\\t46\\n193\\t1\\t46\\n195\\t1\\t46\\n198\\t1\\t46\\n201\\t1\\t46\\n206\\t1\\t46\\n207\\t1\\t46\\n208\\t1\\t46\\n266\\t1\\t46\\n269\\t3\\t46\\n278\\t1\\t46\\n280\\t2\\t46\\n282\\t1\\t46\\n290\\t2\\t46\\n367\\t1\\t46\\n395\\t1\\t46\\n415\\t1\\t46\\n759\\t1\\t46\\n760\\t1\\t46\\n767\\t2\\t46\\n774\\t1\\t46\\n778\\t2\\t46\\n891\\t1\\t46\\n905\\t1\\t46\\n925\\t2\\t46\\n943\\t1\\t46\\n952\\t1\\t46\\n953\\t1\\t46\\n964\\t2\\t46\\n968\\t1\\t46\\n977\\t1\\t46\\n983\\t3\\t46\\n1009\\t1\\t46\\n1018\\t1\\t46\\n1019\\t4\\t46\\n1023\\t1\\t46\\n1030\\t1\\t46\\n1086\\t1\\t46\\n1203\\t2\\t46\\n1240\\t1\\t46\\n1359\\t1\\t46\\n1397\\t1\\t46\\n1416\\t2\\t46\\n1417\\t3\\t46\\n1450\\t1\\t46\\n1450\\t1\\t46\\n.I 47\\n.T\\nImprovement of the Selectivity of Citation Indexes to Science Literature\\nThrough Inclusion of Citation Relationship Indicators\\n.A\\nLipetz, Ben-Ami\\n.W\\n   Citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far\\nmore citing references under the known cited reference than the user can \\nafford the time to look up.. By providing some additional information, beyond \\nthe minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, a \\ncitation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list \\nthose citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search \\nrequirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular \\nattention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation \\nentries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication\\nis operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature \\nof the Shepard\\'s legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of \\npotential value to users of science literature is presented.. These \\nrelationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested \\ncategories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the\\nscientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the\\ncited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation \\nrequires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve\\nthe use of subject terminology..

Author indexing of\\n285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author-\\nsupplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that \\nwas  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same\\ndocument.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The\\naverage author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than \\none member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as \\ncompared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and \\ncriterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing \\nderived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by an\\nauthor should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own \\nabout as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general method\\ndeveloped for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of \\nwide applicability..\\n.X\\n35\\t1\\t52\\n38\\t2\\t52\\n42\\t1\\t52\\n43\\t1\\t52\\n52\\t6\\t52\\n61\\t1\\t52\\n70\\t1\\t52\\n73\\t2\\t52\\n75\\t1\\t52\\n81\\t2\\t52\\n82\\t1\\t52\\n95\\t1\\t52\\n150\\t2\\t52\\n420\\t1\\t52\\n429\\t1\\t52\\n455\\t1\\t52\\n510\\t1\\t52\\n578\\t1\\t52\\n582\\t2\\t52\\n589\\t3\\t52\\n594\\t1\\t52\\n595\\t1\\t52\\n603\\t2\\t52\\n655\\t1\\t52\\n656\\t1\\t52\\n657\\t1\\t52\\n722\\t2\\t52\\n781\\t1\\t52\\n799\\t1\\t52\\n830\\t1\\t52\\n893\\t1\\t52\\n1054\\t1\\t52\\n1144\\t1\\t52\\n1154\\t1\\t52\\n1195\\t2\\t52\\n1232\\t1\\t52\\n1255\\t1\\t52\\n1281\\t1\\t52\\n1295\\t1\\t52\\n1298\\t1\\t52\\n1421\\t1\\t52\\n1421\\t1\\t52\\n.I 53\\n.T\\nThe KWIC Index Concept: A Retrospective View\\n.A\\nFischer, Marguerite\\n.W\\n   This paper defines and describes the KWIC (keyword in context) index concept,\\nproviding a history of the concept and of its literature..

As an application of this \\nprinciple to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items\\nshould be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will \\nyield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be\\nfeasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search \\nzones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative\\nefficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone \\nsizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off\\nbetween file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully \\nevaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature \\nappears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to \\ndemonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters \\nobtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan\\nto scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents \\nare examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a \\nsearch over the remainder of the file..\\n.X\\n24\\t1\\t62\\n44\\t1\\t62\\n61\\t1\\t62\\n62\\t10\\t62\\n65\\t1\\t62\\n66\\t1\\t62\\n67\\t2\\t62\\n75\\t1\\t62\\n76\\t1\\t62\\n137\\t1\\t62\\n172\\t1\\t62\\n175\\t2\\t62\\n210\\t1\\t62\\n278\\t1\\t62\\n279\\t1\\t62\\n280\\t1\\t62\\n310\\t1\\t62\\n316\\t1\\t62\\n318\\t1\\t62\\n359\\t3\\t62\\n360\\t1\\t62\\n363\\t1\\t62\\n382\\t1\\t62\\n386\\t1\\t62\\n395\\t1\\t62\\n398\\t1\\t62\\n409\\t1\\t62\\n435\\t1\\t62\\n458\\t1\\t62\\n462\\t1\\t62\\n483\\t1\\t62\\n484\\t1\\t62\\n567\\t1\\t62\\n604\\t1\\t62\\n658\\t1\\t62\\n716\\t1\\t62\\n737\\t1\\t62\\n748\\t1\\t62\\n751\\t1\\t62\\n765\\t2\\t62\\n778\\t3\\t62\\n779\\t1\\t62\\n782\\t1\\t62\\n788\\t1\\t62\\n789\\t1\\t62\\n837\\t1\\t62\\n853\\t1\\t62\\n875\\t1\\t62\\n883\\t1\\t62\\n893\\t1\\t62\\n907\\t1\\t62\\n925\\t1\\t62\\n1083\\t1\\t62\\n1085\\t1\\t62\\n1173\\t1\\t62\\n1184\\t1\\t62\\n1187\\t2\\t62\\n1219\\t1\\t62\\n1268\\t1\\t62\\n1274\\t1\\t62\\n1361\\t1\\t62\\n1400\\t1\\t62\\n1404\\t1\\t62\\n1416\\t1\\t62\\n1417\\t2\\t62\\n1418\\t1\\t62\\n1419\\t1\\t62\\n1426\\t1\\t62\\n1426\\t1\\t62\\n.I 63\\n.T\\nThe Publication Inflation\\n.A\\nLondon, Gertrude\\n.W\\n   The much-vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a \\nrather generalized publication inflation..

The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication\\nfrom the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of \\npublication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to \\nproduce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern \\ninformation which is entered into the master record for each title causes\\ncheck-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the\\ncomputer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next\\nmonth, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to \\npredict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time \\nperiod..

Questions were collected from eye \\nresearchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different \\nsecondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to \\nthe eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye\\nresearch interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number\\nof journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye\\nresearchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign \\nlanguages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more \\nthan 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the \\nmailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the \\nresearchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective\\nsearches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and \\nExcerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources..\\nMEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual \\nsearches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be\\nequally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were\\nsubsequently rated as relevant by the researchers..

This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response \\nto a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred \\n(\"answer-providing documents\").. \"Answer can be inferred from document\" has \\nmany possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an \"inference \\nspecification\").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the \\ncorrectness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., \\nany inference specification can only approximate scientific inference \\npractices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference \\npractices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs \\nin a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some \\napparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is\\ndescribed which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a \\nquestion.. However, because the indexing is \"nonrelational\", it could cause \\nfalse retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals \\nare   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for \\nhelping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for \\nretrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately..\\n.X\\n29\\t1\\t68\\n58\\t4\\t68\\n68\\t7\\t68\\n69\\t1\\t68\\n77\\t1\\t68\\n78\\t1\\t68\\n79\\t1\\t68\\n84\\t3\\t68\\n117\\t1\\t68\\n175\\t2\\t68\\n261\\t1\\t68\\n346\\t1\\t68\\n382\\t1\\t68\\n420\\t1\\t68\\n458\\t1\\t68\\n476\\t1\\t68\\n477\\t1\\t68\\n478\\t1\\t68\\n479\\t1\\t68\\n480\\t1\\t68\\n484\\t1\\t68\\n485\\t1\\t68\\n566\\t1\\t68\\n571\\t1\\t68\\n590\\t1\\t68\\n595\\t1\\t68\\n680\\t1\\t68\\n683\\t1\\t68\\n689\\t1\\t68\\n704\\t1\\t68\\n781\\t1\\t68\\n790\\t1\\t68\\n1118\\t2\\t68\\n1124\\t1\\t68\\n1131\\t1\\t68\\n1175\\t1\\t68\\n1382\\t1\\t68\\n1382\\t1\\t68\\n.I 69\\n.T\\nStatistical Generation of a Technical Vocabulary\\n.A\\nStone, D.

E.\\n.W\\n   The SMART automatic document retrieval system is used to study association \\nprocedures for automatic content analysis.. The effect of word frequency and \\nother parameters on the association process is investigated through examination\\nof related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words\\nusually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be\\nfound from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. \\nThere is little overlap between word relationships found through associations \\nand those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations \\nand a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in \\nretrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches \\nbetween requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing \\nmatches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of \\nthe improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus,\\nhowever, offers better performance than statistical association methods..\\n.X\\n30\\t1\\t71\\n51\\t1\\t71\\n61\\t1\\t71\\n67\\t1\\t71\\n69\\t1\\t71\\n70\\t1\\t71\\n71\\t6\\t71\\n72\\t2\\t71\\n73\\t2\\t71\\n74\\t1\\t71\\n75\\t2\\t71\\n77\\t3\\t71\\n78\\t2\\t71\\n79\\t3\\t71\\n80\\t1\\t71\\n81\\t2\\t71\\n82\\t2\\t71\\n83\\t2\\t71\\n86\\t1\\t71\\n135\\t1\\t71\\n153\\t1\\t71\\n154\\t1\\t71\\n156\\t1\\t71\\n168\\t1\\t71\\n175\\t3\\t71\\n176\\t2\\t71\\n206\\t1\\t71\\n207\\t1\\t71\\n208\\t1\\t71\\n211\\t1\\t71\\n212\\t2\\t71\\n245\\t1\\t71\\n247\\t1\\t71\\n277\\t1\\t71\\n279\\t1\\t71\\n280\\t1\\t71\\n315\\t1\\t71\\n382\\t2\\t71\\n389\\t1\\t71\\n390\\t1\\t71\\n448\\t2\\t71\\n458\\t2\\t71\\n480\\t1\\t71\\n481\\t1\\t71\\n483\\t2\\t71\\n484\\t1\\t71\\n485\\t1\\t71\\n486\\t2\\t71\\n488\\t3\\t71\\n491\\t1\\t71\\n493\\t1\\t71\\n503\\t1\\t71\\n507\\t1\\t71\\n509\\t2\\t71\\n510\\t1\\t71\\n512\\t1\\t71\\n517\\t1\\t71\\n520\\t1\\t71\\n522\\t1\\t71\\n527\\t1\\t71\\n528\\t1\\t71\\n531\\t1\\t71\\n565\\t3\\t71\\n566\\t1\\t71\\n581\\t2\\t71\\n596\\t1\\t71\\n603\\t1\\t71\\n608\\t1\\t71\\n633\\t1\\t71\\n659\\t2\\t71\\n666\\t1\\t71\\n715\\t1\\t71\\n720\\t1\\t71\\n748\\t1\\t71\\n754\\t1\\t71\\n779\\t1\\t71\\n780\\t1\\t71\\n785\\t1\\t71\\n786\\t1\\t71\\n787\\t1\\t71\\n788\\t1\\t71\\n789\\t1\\t71\\n790\\t1\\t71\\n791\\t1\\t71\\n805\\t1\\t71\\n809\\t1\\t71\\n810\\t1\\t71\\n812\\t1\\t71\\n813\\t1\\t71\\n814\\t1\\t71\\n817\\t1\\t71\\n824\\t1\\t71\\n825\\t1\\t71\\n838\\t1\\t71\\n853\\t1\\t71\\n894\\t1\\t71\\n925\\t1\\t71\\n981\\t1\\t71\\n982\\t1\\t71\\n984\\t1\\t71\\n1051\\t1\\t71\\n1294\\t1\\t71\\n1327\\t1\\t71\\n1358\\t1\\t71\\n1393\\t1\\t71\\n1402\\t1\\t71\\n1410\\t1\\t71\\n1417\\t1\\t71\\n1419\\t1\\t71\\n1427\\t1\\t71\\n1431\\t1\\t71\\n1431\\t1\\t71\\n.I 72\\n.T\\nA Comparison Between Manual and Automatic Indexing Methods\\n.A\\nSalton, Gerard\\n.W\\n   The effectiveness of conventional document indexing is compared with that \\nachievable by fully automatic text processing methods..

Toward this end, the \\nNegotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of \\ninformation from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a\\ntraditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a \\nframework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data \\nwhich he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which \\nindicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display\\nformats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is \\ndirected toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equally\\nuseful to the searcher..\\n.X\\n24\\t1\\t78\\n26\\t1\\t78\\n30\\t1\\t78\\n68\\t1\\t78\\n71\\t2\\t78\\n72\\t1\\t78\\n73\\t1\\t78\\n74\\t1\\t78\\n75\\t3\\t78\\n77\\t4\\t78\\n78\\t10\\t78\\n79\\t3\\t78\\n80\\t2\\t78\\n81\\t3\\t78\\n82\\t3\\t78\\n83\\t2\\t78\\n86\\t1\\t78\\n153\\t1\\t78\\n154\\t1\\t78\\n156\\t1\\t78\\n175\\t2\\t78\\n177\\t1\\t78\\n180\\t1\\t78\\n211\\t1\\t78\\n212\\t2\\t78\\n245\\t1\\t78\\n247\\t1\\t78\\n277\\t1\\t78\\n279\\t1\\t78\\n280\\t1\\t78\\n281\\t1\\t78\\n336\\t1\\t78\\n420\\t1\\t78\\n483\\t1\\t78\\n486\\t1\\t78\\n498\\t1\\t78\\n501\\t1\\t78\\n562\\t1\\t78\\n581\\t1\\t78\\n593\\t1\\t78\\n595\\t1\\t78\\n666\\t1\\t78\\n720\\t1\\t78\\n748\\t1\\t78\\n785\\t1\\t78\\n786\\t1\\t78\\n787\\t1\\t78\\n788\\t1\\t78\\n789\\t1\\t78\\n790\\t1\\t78\\n791\\t1\\t78\\n838\\t1\\t78\\n852\\t1\\t78\\n853\\t2\\t78\\n854\\t1\\t78\\n855\\t1\\t78\\n925\\t1\\t78\\n984\\t2\\t78\\n1011\\t1\\t78\\n1118\\t1\\t78\\n1124\\t1\\t78\\n1131\\t1\\t78\\n1144\\t1\\t78\\n1294\\t1\\t78\\n1326\\t1\\t78\\n1382\\t1\\t78\\n1393\\t1\\t78\\n1431\\t1\\t78\\n1431\\t1\\t78\\n.I 79\\n.T\\nComputer Selection of Keywords Using Word-Frequency Analysis\\n.A\\nCarroll, John M.\\n.A\\nRoeloffs, Robert\\n.W\\n   A statistically based method for automatically identifying keywords in \\nmachine-readable text has been developed which produces keyword lists that \\nagree better with composite lists produced by panels of human indexers than do \\nlists produced by five statistical criteria previously suggested, and also \\nbetter than lists produced by most of the individual panel members.. The method\\nmakes use of both the in-document word-occurrence frequency and the in-corpus\\nrelative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance.. Each statistical\\ncriterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank\\ncorrelation statistics..

Experimental data on indexing \\nconsistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency,\\nquality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed..

To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the \\npossible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A\\nspecific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be\\ninvalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain\\ninsights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and \\nsuccessful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected..

This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of \\nits applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in \\na way which allows for quantification..

By the use \\nof this model and the definition of a \"true\" science, the goals and requirements \\nfor a curriculum in information science are thus established..

Ordering of author\\' names as an adaptive \\ndevice which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews \\nwith Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of \\nother scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of \\nindividual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected \\ndistribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular \\nsequences, and these preferences vary with the authors\\' eminence.. On the \\nassumptions that authors\\' names are listed in order of the value of their \\ncontributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other \\nscientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse \\noblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their \\neminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent \\nlaureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet \\nunrecognized..

Merton originally introduced\\nthe concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of\\nmultiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is\\ngeneralized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect\\nwere to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be\\ninfluenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.\\nTo test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of\\nsimilar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations\\npapers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of\\npapers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.\\nWe then see whether there were any differences in the reception of\\nthese papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author\\'s\\nlocation in the stratification system.  All the data indicate\\nthat assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important \\ndeterminant of a paper\\'s initial reception than any of the stratification\\nvariables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality\\nis influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work\\nthat is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The\\nMatthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious\\npoints of the social system of science.  All other stratification\\nvariables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards\\ndid not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that\\nindicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no \\nmore likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-\\nranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus\\nattention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with\\nscientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility\\nof the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion\\nis included of the relevance of these data for the study of\\nresistance to scientific discoveries.\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t89\\n36\\t1\\t89\\n39\\t1\\t89\\n41\\t1\\t89\\n76\\t1\\t89\\n88\\t1\\t89\\n89\\t12\\t89\\n97\\t1\\t89\\n98\\t1\\t89\\n100\\t1\\t89\\n102\\t4\\t89\\n105\\t3\\t89\\n107\\t1\\t89\\n109\\t1\\t89\\n110\\t1\\t89\\n111\\t2\\t89\\n112\\t1\\t89\\n113\\t3\\t89\\n155\\t1\\t89\\n157\\t1\\t89\\n163\\t1\\t89\\n183\\t2\\t89\\n184\\t2\\t89\\n193\\t2\\t89\\n198\\t1\\t89\\n199\\t1\\t89\\n201\\t1\\t89\\n203\\t1\\t89\\n204\\t1\\t89\\n210\\t1\\t89\\n225\\t1\\t89\\n269\\t1\\t89\\n308\\t1\\t89\\n312\\t1\\t89\\n314\\t1\\t89\\n356\\t2\\t89\\n359\\t1\\t89\\n373\\t1\\t89\\n384\\t1\\t89\\n391\\t1\\t89\\n544\\t2\\t89\\n545\\t1\\t89\\n552\\t2\\t89\\n560\\t3\\t89\\n582\\t1\\t89\\n587\\t1\\t89\\n589\\t1\\t89\\n602\\t1\\t89\\n605\\t1\\t89\\n613\\t1\\t89\\n614\\t1\\t89\\n632\\t1\\t89\\n638\\t1\\t89\\n656\\t1\\t89\\n685\\t1\\t89\\n722\\t1\\t89\\n735\\t3\\t89\\n747\\t1\\t89\\n750\\t1\\t89\\n753\\t1\\t89\\n766\\t2\\t89\\n767\\t1\\t89\\n775\\t1\\t89\\n782\\t1\\t89\\n784\\t4\\t89\\n788\\t1\\t89\\n789\\t1\\t89\\n793\\t1\\t89\\n800\\t1\\t89\\n808\\t1\\t89\\n828\\t1\\t89\\n905\\t1\\t89\\n953\\t1\\t89\\n977\\t1\\t89\\n983\\t1\\t89\\n1016\\t1\\t89\\n1023\\t1\\t89\\n1030\\t2\\t89\\n1050\\t2\\t89\\n1055\\t2\\t89\\n1062\\t2\\t89\\n1083\\t1\\t89\\n1085\\t1\\t89\\n1087\\t1\\t89\\n1090\\t1\\t89\\n1135\\t1\\t89\\n1256\\t2\\t89\\n1260\\t1\\t89\\n1273\\t1\\t89\\n1275\\t2\\t89\\n1276\\t1\\t89\\n1278\\t1\\t89\\n1280\\t2\\t89\\n1283\\t1\\t89\\n1284\\t1\\t89\\n1285\\t4\\t89\\n1286\\t1\\t89\\n1287\\t2\\t89\\n1290\\t1\\t89\\n1291\\t3\\t89\\n1293\\t1\\t89\\n1294\\t1\\t89\\n1295\\t1\\t89\\n1296\\t3\\t89\\n1297\\t1\\t89\\n1300\\t1\\t89\\n1301\\t1\\t89\\n1302\\t4\\t89\\n1319\\t1\\t89\\n1335\\t1\\t89\\n1339\\t1\\t89\\n1341\\t1\\t89\\n1346\\t4\\t89\\n1347\\t1\\t89\\n1386\\t3\\t89\\n1387\\t1\\t89\\n1390\\t1\\t89\\n1397\\t2\\t89\\n1417\\t1\\t89\\n1428\\t1\\t89\\n1432\\t2\\t89\\n1444\\t1\\t89\\n1444\\t1\\t89\\n.I 90\\n.T \\nInvolving, Computerizing, Personalizing\\n.A\\nKilgour, F.\\n.W\\n  In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement\\nof entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no\\neffort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of\\nvolumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for\\nthat small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users \\nremain nameless.\\n  The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as\\nindividual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential\\nfor enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of\\nwhich classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as\\none-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only\\ncontribution computerization will make to libraries.\\n  Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new\\nobjectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon\\nthat is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special\\nlibraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural\\nactivities of the individuals in their communities rather than\\nmerely make available a torpid \"service.\" Libraries must look forward to\\nsupplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an\\nobjective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.\\n.X\\n5\\t1\\t90\\n33\\t1\\t90\\n36\\t1\\t90\\n90\\t7\\t90\\n91\\t1\\t90\\n158\\t1\\t90\\n161\\t1\\t90\\n183\\t1\\t90\\n184\\t1\\t90\\n193\\t1\\t90\\n199\\t1\\t90\\n201\\t1\\t90\\n202\\t1\\t90\\n203\\t1\\t90\\n204\\t1\\t90\\n205\\t1\\t90\\n209\\t1\\t90\\n212\\t1\\t90\\n217\\t1\\t90\\n220\\t1\\t90\\n222\\t2\\t90\\n223\\t1\\t90\\n231\\t1\\t90\\n261\\t1\\t90\\n284\\t1\\t90\\n286\\t1\\t90\\n289\\t1\\t90\\n294\\t2\\t90\\n295\\t1\\t90\\n299\\t1\\t90\\n334\\t1\\t90\\n348\\t1\\t90\\n354\\t1\\t90\\n368\\t1\\t90\\n435\\t1\\t90\\n543\\t1\\t90\\n553\\t1\\t90\\n588\\t1\\t90\\n608\\t1\\t90\\n610\\t1\\t90\\n612\\t1\\t90\\n613\\t1\\t90\\n615\\t1\\t90\\n617\\t2\\t90\\n620\\t2\\t90\\n624\\t1\\t90\\n799\\t1\\t90\\n800\\t1\\t90\\n808\\t1\\t90\\n815\\t2\\t90\\n868\\t2\\t90\\n869\\t1\\t90\\n872\\t1\\t90\\n897\\t1\\t90\\n938\\t1\\t90\\n939\\t1\\t90\\n957\\t1\\t90\\n959\\t1\\t90\\n963\\t1\\t90\\n990\\t1\\t90\\n991\\t1\\t90\\n992\\t1\\t90\\n1023\\t1\\t90\\n1151\\t1\\t90\\n1196\\t2\\t90\\n1197\\t1\\t90\\n1219\\t1\\t90\\n1221\\t2\\t90\\n1227\\t1\\t90\\n1229\\t1\\t90\\n1318\\t1\\t90\\n1365\\t2\\t90\\n1390\\t2\\t90\\n1390\\t2\\t90\\n.I 91\\n.T\\nWilliams & Wilkins - The Great Leap Backward\\n.A\\nNorth, W.\\n.W\\n  This article contains a call for active participation by all segments of\\nthe library and educational community in the Williams and Wilkins controversy \\nand in the effort to achieve appropriate copyright revision.\\n.X\\n5\\t1\\t91\\n90\\t1\\t91\\n91\\t5\\t91\\n158\\t1\\t91\\n222\\t1\\t91\\n223\\t1\\t91\\n232\\t1\\t91\\n368\\t1\\t91\\n375\\t1\\t91\\n406\\t1\\t91\\n421\\t1\\t91\\n429\\t1\\t91\\n435\\t1\\t91\\n439\\t1\\t91\\n440\\t1\\t91\\n513\\t1\\t91\\n580\\t1\\t91\\n582\\t1\\t91\\n588\\t1\\t91\\n589\\t1\\t91\\n603\\t1\\t91\\n607\\t1\\t91\\n609\\t1\\t91\\n613\\t1\\t91\\n614\\t1\\t91\\n615\\t1\\t91\\n618\\t1\\t91\\n657\\t1\\t91\\n685\\t1\\t91\\n686\\t1\\t91\\n691\\t1\\t91\\n696\\t1\\t91\\n721\\t1\\t91\\n722\\t1\\t91\\n724\\t1\\t91\\n725\\t2\\t91\\n727\\t1\\t91\\n809\\t1\\t91\\n813\\t1\\t91\\n815\\t1\\t91\\n870\\t1\\t91\\n957\\t1\\t91\\n958\\t1\\t91\\n987\\t1\\t91\\n988\\t1\\t91\\n992\\t1\\t91\\n1023\\t1\\t91\\n1057\\t2\\t91\\n1208\\t1\\t91\\n1219\\t1\\t91\\n1227\\t1\\t91\\n1269\\t1\\t91\\n1293\\t1\\t91\\n1298\\t1\\t91\\n1302\\t1\\t91\\n1364\\t2\\t91\\n1365\\t1\\t91\\n1390\\t1\\t91\\n1396\\t1\\t91\\n1396\\t1\\t91\\n.I 92\\n.T\\nOCLC for You - and ME?!\\n.A\\nPlotnick, A.\\n.W\\n  Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; those\\nwho seem to know all about this thing called \"OCLC\" and who keep popping that\\nrounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence,\\nand the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life one\\nacronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLC\\nhas something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress?\\n  Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where\\nthis national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow -\\nis OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.

From\\nthe knowledge that is available, however, we are\\nled to conclude that the communication patterns  \\nin the two areas of activity are not only largely\\nindependent of one another, but qualitatively\\ndifferent in their nature.  This difference is\\nreflected most clearly in the mechanisms by\\nwhich information is diffused within the two\\nsets of practitioners.  The present paper is\\naddressed to these differences and to a discussion\\nof the nature of the communication process between\\nscience and technology.\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t96\\n9\\t1\\t96\\n32\\t1\\t96\\n96\\t6\\t96\\n123\\t1\\t96\\n131\\t1\\t96\\n137\\t1\\t96\\n152\\t1\\t96\\n163\\t1\\t96\\n207\\t1\\t96\\n297\\t1\\t96\\n298\\t1\\t96\\n439\\t1\\t96\\n440\\t1\\t96\\n456\\t1\\t96\\n658\\t2\\t96\\n768\\t1\\t96\\n771\\t1\\t96\\n774\\t1\\t96\\n783\\t1\\t96\\n799\\t1\\t96\\n811\\t1\\t96\\n816\\t1\\t96\\n913\\t1\\t96\\n951\\t1\\t96\\n952\\t1\\t96\\n961\\t1\\t96\\n962\\t1\\t96\\n964\\t1\\t96\\n968\\t1\\t96\\n1030\\t1\\t96\\n1068\\t1\\t96\\n1154\\t1\\t96\\n1203\\t1\\t96\\n1285\\t1\\t96\\n1321\\t3\\t96\\n1339\\t1\\t96\\n1365\\t1\\t96\\n1386\\t1\\t96\\n1407\\t1\\t96\\n1408\\t1\\t96\\n1445\\t1\\t96\\n1445\\t1\\t96\\n.I 97\\n.T\\nBibliographical Citation Characteristics of the Psychological\\nJournal Network in 1950 and in 1960\\n.A\\nXhignesse, L.V.\\nOsgood, C.E.\\n.W\\n  The aforementioned studies are related to the\\nproblem of information exchange in psychology.\\nJournals are a part of the formal channel of scientific\\ncommunication as well as storage elements for\\nthe summary accounts of research undertakings.\\nAnalysis of bibliographical citations thus can\\nreveal certain characteristics of the pattern of\\ninformation flow created by scientists in their\\nwork.

In scientific psychology, this \\noccurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a \\npositive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it\\nis shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring\\nthe mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and\\nfrom the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its \\nconsequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of \\nthe human mind into an experimental science..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t101\\n88\\t1\\t101\\n101\\t6\\t101\\n102\\t2\\t101\\n105\\t1\\t101\\n343\\t2\\t101\\n391\\t1\\t101\\n544\\t1\\t101\\n560\\t1\\t101\\n605\\t1\\t101\\n667\\t1\\t101\\n750\\t1\\t101\\n775\\t1\\t101\\n800\\t1\\t101\\n1063\\t2\\t101\\n1081\\t1\\t101\\n1082\\t1\\t101\\n1088\\t1\\t101\\n1271\\t1\\t101\\n1285\\t1\\t101\\n1286\\t1\\t101\\n1287\\t1\\t101\\n1308\\t1\\t101\\n1310\\t1\\t101\\n1312\\t1\\t101\\n1320\\t1\\t101\\n1334\\t2\\t101\\n1386\\t1\\t101\\n1387\\t1\\t101\\n1387\\t1\\t101\\n.I 102\\n.T\\nScientific Output and Recognition:\\n     A Study in the Operation of the Reward System in Science\\n.A\\nCole, Stephen\\n.A\\nCole, Jonathan R.\\n.W\\n   The relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of \\n120 university physicists was studied..

Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires\\nmailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of a\\nscientists\\' work are studied.. Four strong determinates of visibility were\\nfound: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards \\nreceived for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which\\nthe scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and \\nname-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on \\nvisibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high \\nvisibility), other are in positions where they may easily see.. This latter\\ncharacteristic is called \"awareness\"..The data indicate that awareness is high \\nin all sectors of the population studied.. Variables such as age, rank of \\ndepartment, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness.. \\nWe conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t104\\n48\\t2\\t104\\n76\\t1\\t104\\n95\\t1\\t104\\n102\\t2\\t104\\n103\\t1\\t104\\n104\\t5\\t104\\n106\\t2\\t104\\n108\\t2\\t104\\n110\\t2\\t104\\n111\\t1\\t104\\n112\\t1\\t104\\n113\\t2\\t104\\n161\\t1\\t104\\n170\\t2\\t104\\n456\\t1\\t104\\n545\\t1\\t104\\n560\\t1\\t104\\n582\\t1\\t104\\n584\\t1\\t104\\n589\\t1\\t104\\n655\\t1\\t104\\n793\\t1\\t104\\n893\\t1\\t104\\n1062\\t1\\t104\\n1274\\t1\\t104\\n1285\\t2\\t104\\n1286\\t1\\t104\\n1287\\t3\\t104\\n1291\\t2\\t104\\n1297\\t1\\t104\\n1300\\t1\\t104\\n1304\\t1\\t104\\n1313\\t1\\t104\\n1334\\t1\\t104\\n1338\\t1\\t104\\n1340\\t1\\t104\\n1341\\t1\\t104\\n1342\\t1\\t104\\n1343\\t1\\t104\\n1344\\t2\\t104\\n1346\\t2\\t104\\n1347\\t1\\t104\\n1347\\t1\\t104\\n.I 105\\n.T\\nSocial Structure in a Group of Scientists:\\n A Test of the \"Invisible College\" Hypothesis\\n.A\\nCrane, Diana\\n.W\\n   The existence of social organization within a research area may be inferred \\n(a) if scientists who have published in the area have more social ties with one \\nanother than with scientists who have not published, and (b) scientists who \\nhave published in the area can be differentiated by degree od social \\nparticipation within the area..

Because of feedback\\nthrough recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or\\nincrease their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce\\neven less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the\\ndistribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of\\nscientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for\\nchemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in\\ninequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with \\na changing distribution of time spent on research..

The culture of science, on the other\\nhand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying \\nthose descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network \\nstructures..\\n.X\\n89\\t1\\t109\\n95\\t1\\t109\\n98\\t1\\t109\\n102\\t1\\t109\\n105\\t1\\t109\\n109\\t5\\t109\\n386\\t1\\t109\\n391\\t1\\t109\\n398\\t1\\t109\\n426\\t1\\t109\\n438\\t1\\t109\\n544\\t1\\t109\\n656\\t1\\t109\\n1050\\t1\\t109\\n1063\\t1\\t109\\n1284\\t1\\t109\\n1296\\t1\\t109\\n1300\\t2\\t109\\n1321\\t1\\t109\\n1339\\t1\\t109\\n1385\\t1\\t109\\n1386\\t1\\t109\\n1408\\t1\\t109\\n1408\\t1\\t109\\n.I 110\\n.T\\nThe Gatekeepers of Science:  Some Factors Affecting\\nthe Selection of Articles of Scientific Journals\\n.A\\nCrane, D.\\n.W\\n  The norms of scientific behavior as\\ndescribed by Merton include the\\nprescription that scientific achievements\\nare to be judged without reference to\\nscientists\\' social characteristics.

Most researchers\\nhave typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of\\noutput is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone\\nahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;\\nCrane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed\\nto be no practicable way to measure the quality of large\\nnumbers of papers or the life\\'s work of large numbers of\\nscientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index\\n(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool\\nto measure the significance of individual scientists\\'\\ncontributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all\\nbibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large\\nnumber of journals.  The number of citations an\\nindividual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator\\nof the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of that\\nindividual\\'s publications.\\n.X\\n39\\t1\\t113\\n47\\t1\\t113\\n48\\t4\\t113\\n88\\t1\\t113\\n89\\t3\\t113\\n100\\t1\\t113\\n102\\t7\\t113\\n103\\t1\\t113\\n104\\t2\\t113\\n105\\t2\\t113\\n106\\t3\\t113\\n107\\t1\\t113\\n108\\t2\\t113\\n110\\t2\\t113\\n111\\t6\\t113\\n112\\t4\\t113\\n113\\t14\\t113\\n161\\t1\\t113\\n163\\t1\\t113\\n170\\t1\\t113\\n199\\t1\\t113\\n243\\t1\\t113\\n312\\t1\\t113\\n314\\t2\\t113\\n356\\t2\\t113\\n360\\t1\\t113\\n456\\t1\\t113\\n487\\t1\\t113\\n503\\t1\\t113\\n513\\t1\\t113\\n544\\t1\\t113\\n545\\t4\\t113\\n560\\t3\\t113\\n592\\t1\\t113\\n602\\t1\\t113\\n605\\t1\\t113\\n607\\t1\\t113\\n632\\t1\\t113\\n764\\t1\\t113\\n784\\t1\\t113\\n793\\t2\\t113\\n911\\t1\\t113\\n1030\\t1\\t113\\n1062\\t1\\t113\\n1087\\t1\\t113\\n1210\\t1\\t113\\n1270\\t1\\t113\\n1273\\t3\\t113\\n1274\\t2\\t113\\n1280\\t1\\t113\\n1285\\t4\\t113\\n1287\\t3\\t113\\n1291\\t3\\t113\\n1293\\t1\\t113\\n1296\\t1\\t113\\n1298\\t1\\t113\\n1300\\t3\\t113\\n1301\\t1\\t113\\n1302\\t3\\t113\\n1304\\t2\\t113\\n1308\\t1\\t113\\n1312\\t1\\t113\\n1313\\t3\\t113\\n1315\\t1\\t113\\n1335\\t2\\t113\\n1337\\t2\\t113\\n1338\\t3\\t113\\n1340\\t1\\t113\\n1341\\t2\\t113\\n1344\\t3\\t113\\n1345\\t1\\t113\\n1346\\t5\\t113\\n1347\\t4\\t113\\n1386\\t2\\t113\\n1444\\t1\\t113\\n1444\\t1\\t113\\n.I 114\\n.T\\nThe Analysis of Information Systems\\n.A\\nMeadow, C.T.\\n.W\\n  This book is intended to supply the background needed for\\nparticipation in the analysis and design of information-handling\\nsystems and for understanding the literature in the field.\\nI have tried to present a unified approach to the subject\\nand to the relation of information retrieval to other\\ndisciplines and an appreciation of the importance of this\\ninterdisciplinary relationship.

While we may call ourselves librarians, information\\nscientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists,\\nIS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have one\\nthing in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in the\\ndissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interested\\nin far more than the techniques for transmission of information from\\none point to another.  Despite McLuhan\\'s (93) statement that \"the\\nmedium is the message,\" we must concern ourselves with not only the\\nmeans of document dissemination, but also the content and value of\\nthe documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout\\nmost of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should\\nthink of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data,\\nevaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling\\ntheir transmission to a target: the reader.\\n.X\\n13\\t1\\t121\\n18\\t1\\t121\\n76\\t1\\t121\\n121\\t5\\t121\\n125\\t1\\t121\\n127\\t1\\t121\\n129\\t1\\t121\\n145\\t1\\t121\\n201\\t1\\t121\\n213\\t1\\t121\\n465\\t1\\t121\\n466\\t1\\t121\\n541\\t1\\t121\\n720\\t1\\t121\\n873\\t1\\t121\\n881\\t1\\t121\\n914\\t1\\t121\\n919\\t1\\t121\\n920\\t1\\t121\\n921\\t1\\t121\\n1143\\t1\\t121\\n1362\\t1\\t121\\n1363\\t2\\t121\\n1441\\t1\\t121\\n1441\\t1\\t121\\n.I 122\\n.T \\nInformation Networks\\n.A\\nOverhage, C.F.J.\\n.W\\n  The rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and\\nused in our complex society has presented us with major problems\\nin information transfer.  We encounter these problems not only\\nin libraries, information centers, and schools, but also in many\\nof the operations of government and business.  The handling of large\\namounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management\\nof our way of life.  We are a technologically oriented society, and\\nwe have naturally turned to our communications technology to help\\nus perform our enormous information transfer task.  Beginning with\\nthe telegraph and continuing through the telephone, through radio \\nand television to the communications satellite, the methods of\\nelectrical signal transmission have served to distribute information\\nto its ultimate users.\\n.X\\n24\\t1\\t122\\n74\\t1\\t122\\n75\\t1\\t122\\n119\\t5\\t122\\n122\\t6\\t122\\n336\\t1\\t122\\n365\\t1\\t122\\n394\\t1\\t122\\n452\\t1\\t122\\n453\\t1\\t122\\n526\\t1\\t122\\n528\\t1\\t122\\n612\\t1\\t122\\n684\\t1\\t122\\n855\\t2\\t122\\n872\\t1\\t122\\n903\\t1\\t122\\n907\\t1\\t122\\n908\\t1\\t122\\n940\\t1\\t122\\n955\\t2\\t122\\n1011\\t3\\t122\\n1143\\t1\\t122\\n1247\\t1\\t122\\n1264\\t1\\t122\\n1367\\t1\\t122\\n1435\\t1\\t122\\n1436\\t1\\t122\\n1451\\t1\\t122\\n1451\\t1\\t122\\n.I 123\\n.T\\nAnnual Reviews of Information Science and Technology\\n.A\\nCuadra, C.A.\\n.B\\n1972\\n.W\\n  In spite of concerns expressed in the literature about\\nthe health and vigor of the field of information science and\\nof its service-oriented institutions - libraries and information\\ncenters - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for\\noptimism.  Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6\\nhave proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movement\\ntoward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases \\nis not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before\\nsatisfying experience with this new mode of information access will\\nhelp it become not merely an experimental innovation but the\\nstandard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally)\\nheld data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects \\nof the movement: Bennett\\'s review of the user interface in interactive\\nsystems, Gechman\\'s report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and\\nBrandhorst and Eckert\\'s review of document retrieval and dissemination\\nsystems.\\n  This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially\\ngreat importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes.\\nIt is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in\\nthe coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of\\nsome of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define \\nthe potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other new\\nareas of interest are information system applications in the criminal\\njustice system and information system applications in the humanities.\\n  In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas\\nof information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an\\nannual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description\\nand representation, and organization of information.  This\\ncoverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master\\nplan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest\\nin library and information science.\\n.X\\n96\\t1\\t123\\n123\\t6\\t123\\n131\\t1\\t123\\n376\\t1\\t123\\n439\\t1\\t123\\n440\\t1\\t123\\n459\\t1\\t123\\n634\\t1\\t123\\n791\\t1\\t123\\n804\\t1\\t123\\n885\\t1\\t123\\n1019\\t1\\t123\\n1030\\t1\\t123\\n1037\\t1\\t123\\n1080\\t1\\t123\\n1198\\t1\\t123\\n1386\\t1\\t123\\n1386\\t1\\t123\\n.I 124\\n.T\\nThe User Interface in Interactive Systems\\n.A\\nBennett, J.L.\\n.W\\n  The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for only\\ntwo decades.

Now we are entering a new stage in which computing\\npower is made available through interactive terminals to people who\\nare not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only\\nbecause design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their\\nability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated\\nusers.

It is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even \\nthough it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful \\nlook..\\n.X\\n18\\t2\\t125\\n121\\t1\\t125\\n124\\t1\\t125\\n125\\t7\\t125\\n127\\t2\\t125\\n129\\t2\\t125\\n145\\t2\\t125\\n165\\t1\\t125\\n211\\t1\\t125\\n307\\t1\\t125\\n363\\t1\\t125\\n378\\t1\\t125\\n381\\t1\\t125\\n432\\t1\\t125\\n440\\t1\\t125\\n448\\t1\\t125\\n452\\t2\\t125\\n453\\t1\\t125\\n460\\t1\\t125\\n461\\t1\\t125\\n467\\t1\\t125\\n468\\t1\\t125\\n484\\t1\\t125\\n495\\t1\\t125\\n506\\t1\\t125\\n508\\t1\\t125\\n511\\t2\\t125\\n512\\t1\\t125\\n514\\t1\\t125\\n516\\t1\\t125\\n517\\t1\\t125\\n518\\t1\\t125\\n520\\t1\\t125\\n521\\t2\\t125\\n522\\t1\\t125\\n523\\t2\\t125\\n524\\t1\\t125\\n526\\t2\\t125\\n527\\t1\\t125\\n528\\t2\\t125\\n529\\t1\\t125\\n575\\t1\\t125\\n576\\t1\\t125\\n580\\t2\\t125\\n604\\t1\\t125\\n609\\t1\\t125\\n610\\t1\\t125\\n611\\t1\\t125\\n612\\t2\\t125\\n615\\t1\\t125\\n619\\t1\\t125\\n622\\t2\\t125\\n623\\t1\\t125\\n625\\t1\\t125\\n626\\t1\\t125\\n629\\t1\\t125\\n631\\t1\\t125\\n632\\t1\\t125\\n633\\t1\\t125\\n636\\t1\\t125\\n642\\t1\\t125\\n643\\t1\\t125\\n644\\t1\\t125\\n645\\t1\\t125\\n646\\t1\\t125\\n649\\t1\\t125\\n650\\t1\\t125\\n699\\t1\\t125\\n700\\t2\\t125\\n705\\t2\\t125\\n707\\t2\\t125\\n708\\t1\\t125\\n723\\t1\\t125\\n726\\t1\\t125\\n727\\t2\\t125\\n728\\t1\\t125\\n729\\t1\\t125\\n730\\t1\\t125\\n731\\t1\\t125\\n736\\t1\\t125\\n737\\t1\\t125\\n738\\t1\\t125\\n739\\t1\\t125\\n740\\t1\\t125\\n741\\t1\\t125\\n743\\t1\\t125\\n754\\t2\\t125\\n812\\t2\\t125\\n813\\t1\\t125\\n814\\t1\\t125\\n817\\t1\\t125\\n820\\t1\\t125\\n822\\t1\\t125\\n824\\t1\\t125\\n866\\t1\\t125\\n870\\t1\\t125\\n873\\t1\\t125\\n875\\t1\\t125\\n1078\\t1\\t125\\n1089\\t1\\t125\\n1091\\t1\\t125\\n1143\\t3\\t125\\n1264\\t1\\t125\\n1302\\t1\\t125\\n1303\\t2\\t125\\n1327\\t1\\t125\\n1364\\t1\\t125\\n1366\\t3\\t125\\n1367\\t4\\t125\\n1368\\t3\\t125\\n1374\\t2\\t125\\n1376\\t2\\t125\\n1396\\t1\\t125\\n1396\\t1\\t125\\n.I 126\\n.T\\nAnnual Reviews of Information Science and Technology\\n.A\\nCuadra, C.A.\\n.B\\n1974\\n.W\\n  The major trends of the 1970\\'s in information system planning and\\nservices are becoming clear, as indicated in this year\\'s Annual Review\\nchapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,\\nbegan gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment\\nof many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts\\nto use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\"\\nThese movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being\\ncost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only\\npromises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new\\nproblems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions\\nrequires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance\\nto a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user\\nsubgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning\\nand design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\"\\nissue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and\\nconsiderations.\\n  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth\\nin the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated\\nby the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The\\napparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same\\nproblems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among\\nlibrary and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed\\nmaterials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less\\nrapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,\\nserials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The\\ninclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -\\nreflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the\\nownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that\\ncontroversy - the role of government and non-profit information services\\nin relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year\\'s\\nchapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.\\n.X\\n126\\t7\\t126\\n131\\t1\\t126\\n449\\t1\\t126\\n525\\t1\\t126\\n526\\t1\\t126\\n533\\t1\\t126\\n574\\t1\\t126\\n616\\t1\\t126\\n640\\t1\\t126\\n823\\t1\\t126\\n1035\\t1\\t126\\n1305\\t1\\t126\\n1306\\t1\\t126\\n1313\\t1\\t126\\n1313\\t1\\t126\\n.I 127\\n.T\\nUse of Machine-Readable Data Bases\\n.A\\nWilliams, M.E.\\n.W\\n  This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled \"Use of Machine-\\nReadable Data Bases.\"  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than\\na one-year period.

In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate sets\\nof activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and\\ntesting of new information system structures and modification of existing\\nstructures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational\\nsystems and system components.  However, \"design\" includes not only the\\nformulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for\\nevaluation in accordance with expectations.  \"Evaluation\" applies to\\ntesting design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations\\nfor the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the\\nappraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system\\noperability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications\\nthat require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of \"design\" and\\n\"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in\\nhis 1969 review.\\n  \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or with\\nrespect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly,\\ndesigners and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of\\noutcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature\\ndiscloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on\\ntheir products.\\n.X\\n120\\t1\\t128\\n128\\t6\\t128\\n129\\t1\\t128\\n130\\t2\\t128\\n135\\t1\\t128\\n167\\t1\\t128\\n191\\t1\\t128\\n223\\t1\\t128\\n225\\t1\\t128\\n234\\t1\\t128\\n244\\t1\\t128\\n245\\t1\\t128\\n280\\t1\\t128\\n291\\t1\\t128\\n330\\t1\\t128\\n339\\t1\\t128\\n370\\t1\\t128\\n376\\t1\\t128\\n387\\t1\\t128\\n393\\t1\\t128\\n453\\t1\\t128\\n459\\t1\\t128\\n468\\t1\\t128\\n494\\t1\\t128\\n560\\t1\\t128\\n575\\t1\\t128\\n599\\t1\\t128\\n621\\t1\\t128\\n623\\t1\\t128\\n629\\t1\\t128\\n630\\t1\\t128\\n639\\t1\\t128\\n646\\t3\\t128\\n647\\t2\\t128\\n648\\t1\\t128\\n651\\t1\\t128\\n652\\t2\\t128\\n692\\t1\\t128\\n729\\t1\\t128\\n744\\t1\\t128\\n748\\t1\\t128\\n757\\t1\\t128\\n765\\t1\\t128\\n818\\t1\\t128\\n822\\t1\\t128\\n823\\t2\\t128\\n827\\t2\\t128\\n831\\t1\\t128\\n888\\t1\\t128\\n893\\t1\\t128\\n919\\t1\\t128\\n925\\t2\\t128\\n943\\t1\\t128\\n944\\t1\\t128\\n1003\\t1\\t128\\n1070\\t1\\t128\\n1085\\t1\\t128\\n1291\\t1\\t128\\n1315\\t1\\t128\\n1340\\t1\\t128\\n1374\\t1\\t128\\n1375\\t1\\t128\\n1376\\t2\\t128\\n1390\\t1\\t128\\n1401\\t1\\t128\\n1402\\t1\\t128\\n1403\\t1\\t128\\n1437\\t1\\t128\\n1445\\t1\\t128\\n1457\\t1\\t128\\n1457\\t1\\t128\\n.I 129\\n.T\\nGeneration and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases\\n.A\\nSchipma, P.B.\\n.W\\n  This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of\\nmachine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It\\nis therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared\\nin general accordance with Williams\\'s initial compilation.\\n  The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications\\nused in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered\\nto be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing\\nbibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).\\nThe data bases that we will consider are used for information storage\\nand retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or\\ndata base generation.\\n  The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First,\\ndata bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic\\ninformation, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.\\nThus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number\\nis a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as\\nthat by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)\\nare excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material\\nis included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most\\nof the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a\\nshipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this\\nchapter.

This field, which will be referred to as \"Information\\nScience and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a number\\nof sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element\\nthat provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a\\nshared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation,\\ncommunication, storage, retrieval, and use.\\n  Because of the universality of information processes, and also because\\nof the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very\\nlittle agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology,\\nor about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it\\nsimply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood\\nfield of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell,\\neven clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means and\\nparticularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a\\ncommodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged.\\nDistressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need\\nnot and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest\\nto users, designers, and students of information systems and services.\\nThe purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume,\\nis to provide such a review.\\n.X\\n40\\t1\\t131\\n50\\t2\\t131\\n96\\t1\\t131\\n114\\t1\\t131\\n123\\t1\\t131\\n126\\t1\\t131\\n131\\t15\\t131\\n133\\t6\\t131\\n136\\t5\\t131\\n138\\t3\\t131\\n140\\t3\\t131\\n144\\t1\\t131\\n175\\t3\\t131\\n206\\t1\\t131\\n207\\t1\\t131\\n311\\t1\\t131\\n359\\t2\\t131\\n382\\t1\\t131\\n395\\t1\\t131\\n456\\t1\\t131\\n634\\t1\\t131\\n769\\t1\\t131\\n780\\t1\\t131\\n785\\t1\\t131\\n791\\t1\\t131\\n804\\t1\\t131\\n907\\t1\\t131\\n965\\t1\\t131\\n966\\t1\\t131\\n1019\\t1\\t131\\n1035\\t1\\t131\\n1037\\t1\\t131\\n1083\\t1\\t131\\n1255\\t1\\t131\\n1321\\t1\\t131\\n1327\\t1\\t131\\n1327\\t1\\t131\\n.I 132\\n.T\\nInformation Needs and Uses in Science and Technology\\n.A\\nMenzel, H.\\n.W\\nThe way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information\\nsystems at their disposal, the demands that they put to them, the\\nsatisfaction achieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on their\\nfurther work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise\\nplanning of science information systems and policy.  Besides, these\\nmatters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested\\nin human organization and communication.  While \"user studies\" have\\nnot yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963\\nseems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research\\non the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For\\nthis first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that\\nmade their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the\\nreader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research\\nhas witnessed progress along the following lines:\\n    Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application\\n  of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in\\n  this field earlier in less rigorous forms;\\n    The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution\\n  development records; comparison of research teams working on identical\\n  tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before; \\n  and\\n    An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the\\n  information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American\\n  Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research\\n  in this area.\\n.X\\n2\\t1\\t132\\n14\\t1\\t132\\n41\\t1\\t132\\n76\\t1\\t132\\n132\\t9\\t132\\n137\\t5\\t132\\n139\\t2\\t132\\n147\\t1\\t132\\n152\\t1\\t132\\n155\\t1\\t132\\n161\\t1\\t132\\n183\\t1\\t132\\n195\\t1\\t132\\n202\\t1\\t132\\n203\\t1\\t132\\n204\\t1\\t132\\n210\\t1\\t132\\n237\\t1\\t132\\n272\\t1\\t132\\n274\\t1\\t132\\n276\\t1\\t132\\n475\\t1\\t132\\n552\\t1\\t132\\n655\\t1\\t132\\n760\\t1\\t132\\n767\\t1\\t132\\n771\\t1\\t132\\n772\\t2\\t132\\n774\\t1\\t132\\n775\\t1\\t132\\n783\\t1\\t132\\n788\\t1\\t132\\n789\\t1\\t132\\n952\\t1\\t132\\n965\\t1\\t132\\n977\\t1\\t132\\n1030\\t1\\t132\\n1055\\t1\\t132\\n1056\\t1\\t132\\n1095\\t1\\t132\\n1102\\t1\\t132\\n1111\\t1\\t132\\n1275\\t1\\t132\\n1280\\t1\\t132\\n1321\\t1\\t132\\n1445\\t1\\t132\\n1446\\t1\\t132\\n1447\\t1\\t132\\n1451\\t1\\t132\\n1451\\t1\\t132\\n.I 133\\n.T  \\nThe Annual Review of Information Science and Technology\\n.A\\nCuadra, C.A.\\n.B\\n1967\\n.W\\n  This volume is the second in a series of Annual Reviews of progress in the\\nfield of Information Science and Technology.

Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and\\nevaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field\\nduring the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards\\nand our means of professional communication.\\n  The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and\\ngrow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of\\ninterest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coverage\\nchanges.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information\\nCenters, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering \\nautomation of technical processes and the other covering document\\nnetworks, and a new chapter has been added on information system\\napplications in education.  Such applications are important not just because\\nthey involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but\\nbecause they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of\\nvalue to anyone interested in the total communication process.\\n   At the same time, \"core\" chapters of the review are continued:  information\\nneeds and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization\\nand search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language\\nprocessing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation;\\nand professional aspects of information science.\\nThese topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their\\nannual literature is significant, large, and growing.\\n.X\\n40\\t1\\t136\\n131\\t5\\t136\\n133\\t5\\t136\\n136\\t7\\t136\\n138\\t3\\t136\\n140\\t3\\t136\\n175\\t1\\t136\\n206\\t1\\t136\\n207\\t1\\t136\\n359\\t1\\t136\\n907\\t1\\t136\\n1083\\t1\\t136\\n1327\\t1\\t136\\n1327\\t1\\t136\\n.I 137\\n.T\\nInformation Needs and Uses\\n.A\\nPaisley, W.J.\\n.W\\n  Information science meets behavioral science in the study of information\\nneeds and uses.  At first, the meeting of these fields was inconclusive.  Until\\nthe mid-1960\\'s, there were only a few substantial studies of information\\nneeds and uses.

The basic objective -\\nto provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review\\never prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the\\nbasic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues\\nto be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify,\\nlocate, and examine interesting and important sources of information\\nabout various aspects of our technical progress.\\n  Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the\\nfirst time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on\\nthe international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also,\\nthe topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually\\ncovered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this\\nyear.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better\\nsignposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several\\nmajor segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of\\nthe section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some\\ninstances, one or two highlights of the year\\'s technical progress.\\n.X\\n131\\t3\\t138\\n133\\t3\\t138\\n136\\t3\\t138\\n138\\t6\\t138\\n140\\t4\\t138\\n175\\t1\\t138\\n355\\t1\\t138\\n359\\t1\\t138\\n1083\\t1\\t138\\n1327\\t1\\t138\\n1327\\t1\\t138\\n.I 139\\n.T\\nInformation Needs and Uses\\n.A\\nAllen, T.J.\\n.W\\n  Previous authors in this series, writing on this subject, have usually felt \\nit necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the\\nmethodology of \"user\" studies.

The increasing interest in\\nand movement toward library networks and other cooperative,\\ntechnology-supported information activities have helped to focus\\nspecial attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology,\\nthe two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems,\\nbut also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications.\\nThus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first\\ntime, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry\\nthat have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use\\ninformation-handling systems.\\n  Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems\\nand information systems in state and local government.  While\\nthe intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of\\nservices they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of\\nlibrary and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral\\nareas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the\\nAnnual Review\\'s covering one or more of these areas each year is to\\nhelp its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving\\ntechniques they are fostering.\\n.X\\n131\\t3\\t140\\n133\\t3\\t140\\n136\\t3\\t140\\n138\\t4\\t140\\n140\\t7\\t140\\n175\\t1\\t140\\n359\\t1\\t140\\n1053\\t1\\t140\\n1083\\t1\\t140\\n1327\\t1\\t140\\n1426\\t1\\t140\\n1426\\t1\\t140\\n.I 141\\n.T\\nApplication of Computer Technology to Library Process: a syllabus\\n.A\\nBecker, J.\\n.W\\n  The application of computer technology to library and\\nnetwork processes and services is not an end in itself, but\\nrather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand\\nfor library services and the ability of libraries to provide\\nthose services.  Libraries have assumed the active role of\\nserving the informational, educational and recreational needs\\nof the population.  The size of that population grows constantly,\\nits educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of\\nleisure time is increasing.\\n  The application of computer technology to libraries,\\nespecially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in\\nthe performance of library functions, is a complex process\\nand demands the highest level of talent of both the library\\nand computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be\\naccomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design\\nof a library system is a team effort between librarians,\\ncomputer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a\\nlimited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to\\nfit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest\\nproject will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For\\nthese reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at\\nleast a general overview of what library automation is all\\nabout.\\n.X\\n141\\t7\\t141\\n244\\t1\\t141\\n299\\t2\\t141\\n333\\t1\\t141\\n363\\t1\\t141\\n365\\t1\\t141\\n409\\t1\\t141\\n522\\t1\\t141\\n529\\t1\\t141\\n530\\t1\\t141\\n627\\t1\\t141\\n628\\t1\\t141\\n630\\t1\\t141\\n645\\t1\\t141\\n647\\t1\\t141\\n651\\t1\\t141\\n739\\t1\\t141\\n822\\t1\\t141\\n854\\t1\\t141\\n871\\t1\\t141\\n872\\t1\\t141\\n873\\t2\\t141\\n874\\t2\\t141\\n875\\t2\\t141\\n876\\t2\\t141\\n877\\t1\\t141\\n878\\t1\\t141\\n879\\t1\\t141\\n880\\t1\\t141\\n881\\t1\\t141\\n882\\t1\\t141\\n883\\t1\\t141\\n884\\t1\\t141\\n885\\t1\\t141\\n886\\t1\\t141\\n887\\t1\\t141\\n892\\t2\\t141\\n917\\t1\\t141\\n940\\t1\\t141\\n941\\t2\\t141\\n990\\t1\\t141\\n994\\t2\\t141\\n995\\t1\\t141\\n996\\t1\\t141\\n997\\t2\\t141\\n998\\t2\\t141\\n999\\t1\\t141\\n1000\\t1\\t141\\n1001\\t1\\t141\\n1002\\t1\\t141\\n1003\\t1\\t141\\n1004\\t1\\t141\\n1079\\t2\\t141\\n1143\\t1\\t141\\n1153\\t1\\t141\\n1189\\t1\\t141\\n1230\\t1\\t141\\n1251\\t1\\t141\\n1257\\t1\\t141\\n1303\\t1\\t141\\n1351\\t1\\t141\\n1375\\t1\\t141\\n1376\\t1\\t141\\n1396\\t2\\t141\\n1420\\t1\\t141\\n1434\\t1\\t141\\n1435\\t2\\t141\\n1436\\t1\\t141\\n1442\\t1\\t141\\n1442\\t1\\t141\\n.I 142\\n.T\\nArchives and Library Relations\\n.A\\nClark, R.C.\\n.W\\n  A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and\\nrecord knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay to\\nsatellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded\\nknowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this\\npurpose.\\n  The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is\\nconstantly being elevated as more and more information is presented.\\nWithout information and its necessary control, a society is not only\\nstagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled\\nby archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it\\nis destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.\\n  Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives\\ncontained the best of society\\'s accumulated knowledge; and as nations\\ngrew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a\\ncountry\\'s aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and\\nlibraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to\\nsucceeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this\\nway, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass\\nthis memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions\\ncontain the written and graphic record of social memory and human\\nheritage and provide society with information on which to base actions,\\ndevelop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.\\n.X\\n142\\t5\\t142\\n1064\\t1\\t142\\n1064\\t1\\t142\\n.I 143\\n.T\\nThe Area Specialist Bibliographer: an inquiry into his role \\n.A\\nStuart, R.D.\\n.W\\n  It is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed\\nto eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and\\nto improve administrative procedures for future development\\nof area programs.

For some\\ntime we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation\\nAlert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific\\nInformation as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These\\nthree sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the\\nsame ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current\\nawareness service.\\n  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only\\nauthors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by \\nbreaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.\\nCBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with\\nbiological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for\\ncomputer search.  The computer can also search for molecular\\nformulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all\\ncompounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form\\nwas based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of\\nreferences to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers\\nciting this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a \\'term search\\', which\\nis a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore\\nanalogous to a CT search.\\n  This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so\\nfar with these three services, and the potential use of systems of\\nthis type.\\n.X\\n38\\t2\\t150\\n40\\t1\\t150\\n52\\t2\\t150\\n53\\t1\\t150\\n54\\t1\\t150\\n150\\t9\\t150\\n319\\t1\\t150\\n347\\t1\\t150\\n371\\t1\\t150\\n429\\t1\\t150\\n465\\t2\\t150\\n480\\t1\\t150\\n510\\t2\\t150\\n582\\t2\\t150\\n589\\t4\\t150\\n603\\t3\\t150\\n660\\t2\\t150\\n662\\t1\\t150\\n681\\t1\\t150\\n682\\t1\\t150\\n704\\t1\\t150\\n711\\t1\\t150\\n714\\t1\\t150\\n716\\t1\\t150\\n717\\t1\\t150\\n722\\t2\\t150\\n726\\t1\\t150\\n782\\t1\\t150\\n807\\t1\\t150\\n810\\t1\\t150\\n813\\t1\\t150\\n820\\t1\\t150\\n830\\t1\\t150\\n1089\\t1\\t150\\n1144\\t1\\t150\\n1151\\t1\\t150\\n1195\\t3\\t150\\n1281\\t1\\t150\\n1421\\t1\\t150\\n1448\\t1\\t150\\n1448\\t1\\t150\\n.I 151\\n.T\\nThesaurus Compilation Methods:  A Literature Review\\n.A\\nBlagden, J.F.\\n.W\\n  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific\\nand Technical Information and the end product of the complete\\nresearch will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research\\nin the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being \\nconducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,\\nand K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of\\nBusiness Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the\\nconstruction of a faceted classification scheme for management,\\nthis investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing\\nfaceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.\\n  A study of existing information retrieval systems in the\\nmanagement field has already been made, so a decision to adopt\\nsome form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative\\nstudy of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also\\nalready been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,\\nwas eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield\\nresults that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of\\nnatural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily\\nbecause these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical\\ncollection, and it may well be that the natural language of this\\ndiscipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is\\ncertainly not the case with the rather \\'soft\\' language of\\nmanagement.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who\\nquotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic\\nchemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social\\nscience (20 per cent).\\n  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,\\nMastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment\\navailable to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.\\n.X\\n148\\t1\\t151\\n151\\t6\\t151\\n454\\t1\\t151\\n477\\t1\\t151\\n501\\t2\\t151\\n504\\t3\\t151\\n653\\t1\\t151\\n773\\t1\\t151\\n781\\t1\\t151\\n798\\t2\\t151\\n802\\t1\\t151\\n1118\\t2\\t151\\n1122\\t1\\t151\\n1123\\t1\\t151\\n1133\\t1\\t151\\n1141\\t1\\t151\\n1163\\t1\\t151\\n1175\\t1\\t151\\n1226\\t1\\t151\\n1226\\t1\\t151\\n.I 152\\n.T\\nOrganizational Aspects of Information Flow in Technology\\n.A\\nAllen, T.J.\\n.W\\n  For about five years now a small group of us at MIT\\nhave been conducting a series of investigations into the\\ninformation needs of technologists, the manner in which\\nthese needs are presently met, the relation between\\nvarious ways of fulfilling information needs and technological\\nperformance, and the nature of factors which determine the ways\\nin which information needs will be fulfilled.\\n.X\\n2\\t2\\t152\\n13\\t1\\t152\\n15\\t1\\t152\\n42\\t1\\t152\\n66\\t1\\t152\\n76\\t1\\t152\\n96\\t1\\t152\\n132\\t1\\t152\\n137\\t1\\t152\\n139\\t1\\t152\\n152\\t13\\t152\\n155\\t1\\t152\\n158\\t1\\t152\\n183\\t1\\t152\\n195\\t1\\t152\\n203\\t1\\t152\\n204\\t1\\t152\\n210\\t1\\t152\\n313\\t1\\t152\\n447\\t1\\t152\\n449\\t1\\t152\\n475\\t2\\t152\\n526\\t1\\t152\\n552\\t1\\t152\\n574\\t1\\t152\\n625\\t1\\t152\\n658\\t1\\t152\\n664\\t1\\t152\\n714\\t1\\t152\\n760\\t1\\t152\\n761\\t1\\t152\\n774\\t1\\t152\\n775\\t1\\t152\\n783\\t1\\t152\\n788\\t1\\t152\\n789\\t1\\t152\\n801\\t1\\t152\\n803\\t1\\t152\\n837\\t1\\t152\\n839\\t1\\t152\\n841\\t1\\t152\\n879\\t1\\t152\\n907\\t2\\t152\\n925\\t1\\t152\\n942\\t1\\t152\\n968\\t1\\t152\\n977\\t1\\t152\\n1055\\t1\\t152\\n1056\\t1\\t152\\n1285\\t1\\t152\\n1317\\t1\\t152\\n1319\\t1\\t152\\n1386\\t1\\t152\\n1394\\t1\\t152\\n1407\\t1\\t152\\n1451\\t1\\t152\\n1451\\t1\\t152\\n.I 153\\n.T\\nCriteria for Evaluating Technical Library Effectiveness\\n.A\\nWessel, C.J.\\n.W\\n  In July 1966 John I.

A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R.\\nReynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject:\\nsuch data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because\\nof the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to\\ndescribe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing\\na costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of\\nstandard conventions for the analysis of information systems.\\n  One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for\\nthese systems, namely:\\n(a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information\\n    systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed\\n    for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al).\\n(b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an\\n    attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting\\n    them.\\n  In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production\\nof current-awareness bulletins.

But the subject\\nindexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB\\'s plans for\\ncomputer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope to\\nshow that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible\\ngeneral system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, it\\nis necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which\\ncaused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the\\ncomputer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing.\\n.X\\n159\\t5\\t159\\n178\\t1\\t159\\n257\\t1\\t159\\n260\\t1\\t159\\n348\\t1\\t159\\n429\\t1\\t159\\n489\\t1\\t159\\n493\\t1\\t159\\n498\\t1\\t159\\n501\\t1\\t159\\n582\\t1\\t159\\n583\\t2\\t159\\n585\\t1\\t159\\n653\\t1\\t159\\n655\\t2\\t159\\n688\\t1\\t159\\n796\\t1\\t159\\n797\\t2\\t159\\n798\\t2\\t159\\n799\\t1\\t159\\n801\\t1\\t159\\n802\\t1\\t159\\n838\\t1\\t159\\n852\\t1\\t159\\n854\\t1\\t159\\n857\\t1\\t159\\n858\\t2\\t159\\n859\\t2\\t159\\n861\\t2\\t159\\n970\\t1\\t159\\n1043\\t1\\t159\\n1252\\t1\\t159\\n1268\\t1\\t159\\n1395\\t1\\t159\\n1405\\t1\\t159\\n1405\\t1\\t159\\n.I 160\\n.T\\nAnalysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval\\n.A\\nFarradane, J.E.L.\\n.W\\n  In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called \\'pure\\' or\\n\\'basic\\' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of\\ninformation science, I will prefer the word \\'basic\\', although there is not so \\nmuch difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one should\\nnot be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and,\\nas far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are\\neliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable\\nproportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of\\nhypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining\\nevidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just \\nthat crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.\\nIf the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon\\nwhich to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one\\nis ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a\\nfully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human\\nsituation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does\\nnot alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology\\nlacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.\\n.X\\n72\\t1\\t160\\n160\\t6\\t160\\n168\\t1\\t160\\n257\\t1\\t160\\n258\\t1\\t160\\n477\\t1\\t160\\n478\\t2\\t160\\n516\\t3\\t160\\n558\\t2\\t160\\n572\\t1\\t160\\n600\\t1\\t160\\n628\\t1\\t160\\n653\\t1\\t160\\n746\\t2\\t160\\n758\\t1\\t160\\n781\\t1\\t160\\n795\\t1\\t160\\n817\\t1\\t160\\n825\\t1\\t160\\n901\\t1\\t160\\n1202\\t1\\t160\\n1215\\t1\\t160\\n1218\\t1\\t160\\n1230\\t1\\t160\\n1394\\t1\\t160\\n1422\\t1\\t160\\n1448\\t1\\t160\\n1448\\t1\\t160\\n.I 161\\n.T\\nUser Studies:  A Review of the Literature from 1966 to 1970\\n.A\\nWood, D.N.\\n.W\\n  My terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were\\nto bring Fishenden\\'s work up to date.  This was published in the Journal of \\nDocumentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number\\nof British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the\\ndevelopment of a national information service.  The present paper which covers\\nthe literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It\\nconsiders a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits \\nof scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results \\nwhich it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop\\npolicies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although\\nan increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and\\nin the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review\\nconsiders mainly British and American investigations.\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t161\\n36\\t1\\t161\\n76\\t1\\t161\\n90\\t1\\t161\\n95\\t1\\t161\\n104\\t1\\t161\\n105\\t1\\t161\\n110\\t1\\t161\\n111\\t1\\t161\\n113\\t1\\t161\\n132\\t1\\t161\\n147\\t1\\t161\\n155\\t1\\t161\\n161\\t15\\t161\\n163\\t2\\t161\\n183\\t1\\t161\\n184\\t1\\t161\\n193\\t1\\t161\\n197\\t1\\t161\\n199\\t1\\t161\\n201\\t1\\t161\\n202\\t1\\t161\\n203\\t1\\t161\\n204\\t1\\t161\\n205\\t1\\t161\\n209\\t1\\t161\\n212\\t1\\t161\\n217\\t1\\t161\\n220\\t1\\t161\\n222\\t1\\t161\\n243\\t1\\t161\\n284\\t1\\t161\\n286\\t1\\t161\\n294\\t1\\t161\\n295\\t1\\t161\\n300\\t1\\t161\\n356\\t1\\t161\\n358\\t1\\t161\\n375\\t1\\t161\\n433\\t1\\t161\\n445\\t1\\t161\\n454\\t1\\t161\\n470\\t1\\t161\\n472\\t1\\t161\\n503\\t1\\t161\\n506\\t1\\t161\\n507\\t1\\t161\\n543\\t1\\t161\\n545\\t1\\t161\\n554\\t1\\t161\\n560\\t2\\t161\\n579\\t1\\t161\\n582\\t1\\t161\\n584\\t1\\t161\\n588\\t1\\t161\\n589\\t1\\t161\\n591\\t1\\t161\\n592\\t1\\t161\\n593\\t1\\t161\\n594\\t1\\t161\\n595\\t1\\t161\\n596\\t1\\t161\\n597\\t1\\t161\\n599\\t1\\t161\\n600\\t1\\t161\\n602\\t1\\t161\\n603\\t1\\t161\\n604\\t1\\t161\\n606\\t1\\t161\\n607\\t1\\t161\\n613\\t1\\t161\\n614\\t1\\t161\\n618\\t1\\t161\\n624\\t3\\t161\\n631\\t1\\t161\\n655\\t1\\t161\\n723\\t1\\t161\\n724\\t1\\t161\\n760\\t1\\t161\\n771\\t1\\t161\\n772\\t2\\t161\\n799\\t1\\t161\\n800\\t1\\t161\\n801\\t1\\t161\\n805\\t1\\t161\\n806\\t1\\t161\\n808\\t1\\t161\\n836\\t1\\t161\\n866\\t1\\t161\\n867\\t1\\t161\\n889\\t1\\t161\\n900\\t1\\t161\\n936\\t1\\t161\\n937\\t1\\t161\\n946\\t1\\t161\\n956\\t1\\t161\\n959\\t1\\t161\\n989\\t1\\t161\\n1030\\t1\\t161\\n1056\\t1\\t161\\n1084\\t1\\t161\\n1095\\t1\\t161\\n1102\\t2\\t161\\n1107\\t1\\t161\\n1111\\t1\\t161\\n1151\\t1\\t161\\n1222\\t1\\t161\\n1287\\t1\\t161\\n1293\\t1\\t161\\n1296\\t1\\t161\\n1297\\t1\\t161\\n1298\\t2\\t161\\n1299\\t1\\t161\\n1300\\t1\\t161\\n1327\\t1\\t161\\n1346\\t1\\t161\\n1347\\t1\\t161\\n1353\\t1\\t161\\n1361\\t1\\t161\\n1373\\t2\\t161\\n1404\\t1\\t161\\n1405\\t1\\t161\\n1446\\t1\\t161\\n1447\\t1\\t161\\n1447\\t1\\t161\\n.I 162\\n.T\\nLibrary and Information Science Abstracts: The First Two Years\\n.A\\nGilcrist, A.\\nPresanis, A.\\n.W\\n  With the thirteenth issue affected by the recent postal strike, now seems\\nan opportune moment to take a look at the performance of LISA in its first two\\nyears.

There are \\na number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much \\nsmaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and\\nless inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries\\nin the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with\\nsocial scientists\\' information needs in the same way as librarians in \\nscientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally,\\nuntil OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this\\nkind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its\\ndisadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we\\nwere therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.

If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing\\nrequirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because\\nthe searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his\\navailable search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of\\norder attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the\\nbasis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these\\npostulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher\\nare its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be\\nmade on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.\\n  The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience\\nwith the IDC-system and its precursors.

In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand\\ncorporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from\\nfive million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their\\ntotal productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assess\\nthe associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely\\nstated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science\\nwould actually be transacted.  It is these \\'substantial changes\\' that concern\\nthe publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we\\ndo not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will\\nnot be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become\\nredundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be\\nironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regard\\nthe chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to \\nopportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort out\\nwhat is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change,\\nselect and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of\\nthe scientist to this mass of information.\\n.X\\n37\\t1\\t166\\n63\\t1\\t166\\n166\\t5\\t166\\n491\\t1\\t166\\n496\\t1\\t166\\n582\\t1\\t166\\n657\\t1\\t166\\n690\\t1\\t166\\n760\\t1\\t166\\n907\\t1\\t166\\n1012\\t1\\t166\\n1111\\t1\\t166\\n1115\\t2\\t166\\n1293\\t1\\t166\\n1295\\t1\\t166\\n1296\\t1\\t166\\n1446\\t1\\t166\\n1447\\t1\\t166\\n1447\\t1\\t166\\n.I 167\\n.T\\nRationalization of Serial Holdings in Special Libraries\\n.A\\nHoughton, B.\\n.A\\nProsser, C.\\n.W\\n   This paper describes progress which has been made toward the development of\\na procedural model intended as a code of good practice to enable special \\nlibrarians to effect economies in their journal holdings by systematically \\nplanned use of the BLL..\\n   A theoretical model suggested by B.

Well over a century ago, it was expressed with \\nreasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but\\nrarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt,\\n1836).  His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finite\\nmeans\" and that its grammar must describe the processes that\\nmake this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent\\nconcern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind,\\nwith this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, see\\nChomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even\\nPanini\\'s grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a\\n\"generative grammar,\" in essentially the contemporary sense of\\nthis term.\\n  This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems\\nthat have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar,\\nwhich is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the\\ndiscussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this\\ntheory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with\\nquestions that are at the border of research in transformational\\ngrammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more\\noften the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible\\napproaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.\\n.X\\n21\\t1\\t168\\n51\\t1\\t168\\n69\\t2\\t168\\n71\\t1\\t168\\n77\\t2\\t168\\n79\\t2\\t168\\n118\\t1\\t168\\n160\\t1\\t168\\n168\\t17\\t168\\n174\\t1\\t168\\n175\\t2\\t168\\n176\\t1\\t168\\n258\\t1\\t168\\n315\\t1\\t168\\n317\\t5\\t168\\n320\\t2\\t168\\n324\\t2\\t168\\n332\\t1\\t168\\n382\\t1\\t168\\n388\\t1\\t168\\n399\\t1\\t168\\n417\\t1\\t168\\n443\\t1\\t168\\n448\\t1\\t168\\n479\\t1\\t168\\n480\\t1\\t168\\n483\\t1\\t168\\n484\\t1\\t168\\n486\\t1\\t168\\n488\\t2\\t168\\n489\\t1\\t168\\n491\\t1\\t168\\n493\\t2\\t168\\n498\\t1\\t168\\n499\\t1\\t168\\n503\\t1\\t168\\n507\\t1\\t168\\n509\\t1\\t168\\n510\\t1\\t168\\n512\\t1\\t168\\n517\\t1\\t168\\n520\\t1\\t168\\n522\\t1\\t168\\n527\\t1\\t168\\n528\\t1\\t168\\n531\\t1\\t168\\n546\\t1\\t168\\n558\\t2\\t168\\n565\\t1\\t168\\n566\\t2\\t168\\n570\\t1\\t168\\n572\\t3\\t168\\n581\\t2\\t168\\n590\\t1\\t168\\n596\\t1\\t168\\n603\\t1\\t168\\n608\\t2\\t168\\n633\\t1\\t168\\n659\\t2\\t168\\n715\\t1\\t168\\n746\\t1\\t168\\n754\\t1\\t168\\n790\\t2\\t168\\n805\\t1\\t168\\n809\\t1\\t168\\n810\\t1\\t168\\n812\\t1\\t168\\n813\\t1\\t168\\n814\\t1\\t168\\n817\\t2\\t168\\n819\\t1\\t168\\n824\\t1\\t168\\n825\\t2\\t168\\n894\\t1\\t168\\n902\\t2\\t168\\n1024\\t1\\t168\\n1027\\t1\\t168\\n1045\\t1\\t168\\n1046\\t3\\t168\\n1047\\t1\\t168\\n1051\\t1\\t168\\n1118\\t1\\t168\\n1144\\t1\\t168\\n1213\\t1\\t168\\n1215\\t2\\t168\\n1225\\t1\\t168\\n1230\\t1\\t168\\n1231\\t1\\t168\\n1294\\t2\\t168\\n1310\\t1\\t168\\n1327\\t2\\t168\\n1386\\t1\\t168\\n1388\\t1\\t168\\n1389\\t1\\t168\\n1399\\t5\\t168\\n1413\\t1\\t168\\n1419\\t1\\t168\\n1427\\t1\\t168\\n1443\\t4\\t168\\n1448\\t1\\t168\\n1448\\t1\\t168\\n.I 169\\n.T\\nThe Assault on Privacy\\n.A\\nMiller, A.R.\\n.W\\n  The genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call I\\nreceived during the fall of 1966 from Dr. James G.

As the strength of\\nnational professional associations of practitioners has increased,\\nconcern with education for the professions has\\nprompted schools to develop standards and curricula to\\nsupport the preparation of practitioners.  During the half\\ncentury spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed\\nnational associations.  The Association of American Medical\\nColleges, for example, was established in 1876.  Other professional\\nschool associations followed:  engineering (1893), law (1900),\\nlibrarianship (1915), theology (1918), and social work (1919).\\nThese associations, to cite a few, have developed in different ways\\nwhile conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels\\nof influence in affecting professional education.\\n.X\\n8\\t1\\t171\\n20\\t1\\t171\\n171\\t5\\t171\\n230\\t1\\t171\\n339\\t1\\t171\\n387\\t1\\t171\\n909\\t1\\t171\\n918\\t1\\t171\\n933\\t1\\t171\\n1061\\t1\\t171\\n1403\\t1\\t171\\n1423\\t1\\t171\\n1453\\t1\\t171\\n1453\\t1\\t171\\n.I 172\\n.T\\nAs We May Think\\n.A\\nBush, V.\\n.W\\n  As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development,\\nDr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six\\nthousand leading American scientists in the application of\\nscience to warfare.  In this significant article he holds up\\nan incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  He\\nurges that men of science should then turn to the massive task\\nof making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.\\nFor years inventions have extended man\\'s physical powers rather than\\nthe powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists,\\nmicroscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and\\ndetection are new results, but not the end results, of modern\\nscience.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly\\ndeveloped, will give man access to and command over the inherited\\nknowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments\\nshould be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from\\ntheir war work.  Like Emerson\\'s famous address of 1837 on \"The\\nAmerican Scholar,\" this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship\\nbetween thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor\\n.X\\n3\\t1\\t172\\n20\\t1\\t172\\n42\\t1\\t172\\n58\\t1\\t172\\n60\\t1\\t172\\n62\\t1\\t172\\n85\\t1\\t172\\n120\\t1\\t172\\n129\\t1\\t172\\n164\\t1\\t172\\n172\\t14\\t172\\n178\\t1\\t172\\n191\\t1\\t172\\n194\\t1\\t172\\n211\\t1\\t172\\n212\\t1\\t172\\n214\\t1\\t172\\n216\\t1\\t172\\n217\\t1\\t172\\n218\\t1\\t172\\n220\\t1\\t172\\n274\\t1\\t172\\n283\\t1\\t172\\n293\\t1\\t172\\n296\\t1\\t172\\n360\\t2\\t172\\n365\\t1\\t172\\n374\\t1\\t172\\n386\\t1\\t172\\n417\\t1\\t172\\n419\\t1\\t172\\n421\\t1\\t172\\n446\\t1\\t172\\n453\\t1\\t172\\n458\\t1\\t172\\n469\\t1\\t172\\n481\\t1\\t172\\n482\\t1\\t172\\n485\\t1\\t172\\n491\\t1\\t172\\n497\\t1\\t172\\n507\\t1\\t172\\n520\\t1\\t172\\n523\\t1\\t172\\n572\\t1\\t172\\n577\\t1\\t172\\n578\\t2\\t172\\n579\\t1\\t172\\n585\\t1\\t172\\n599\\t1\\t172\\n615\\t1\\t172\\n623\\t1\\t172\\n640\\t2\\t172\\n652\\t2\\t172\\n665\\t1\\t172\\n762\\t1\\t172\\n803\\t1\\t172\\n822\\t1\\t172\\n825\\t1\\t172\\n856\\t1\\t172\\n886\\t1\\t172\\n888\\t1\\t172\\n891\\t1\\t172\\n902\\t1\\t172\\n907\\t5\\t172\\n913\\t1\\t172\\n943\\t1\\t172\\n963\\t1\\t172\\n967\\t1\\t172\\n1004\\t1\\t172\\n1022\\t1\\t172\\n1030\\t1\\t172\\n1033\\t1\\t172\\n1045\\t1\\t172\\n1084\\t1\\t172\\n1147\\t1\\t172\\n1150\\t1\\t172\\n1207\\t1\\t172\\n1219\\t2\\t172\\n1257\\t1\\t172\\n1258\\t1\\t172\\n1268\\t4\\t172\\n1279\\t1\\t172\\n1387\\t1\\t172\\n1402\\t1\\t172\\n1417\\t1\\t172\\n1418\\t1\\t172\\n1426\\t3\\t172\\n1433\\t1\\t172\\n1441\\t1\\t172\\n1441\\t1\\t172\\n.I 173\\n.T\\nAuthoritarian Personality\\n.A\\nAdorno, T.W.\\n.W\\n  This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is not\\nsimply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body\\nof information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively new\\nconcept - the rise of an \"anthropological\" species we call the\\nauthoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style\\nhe seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly \\nindustrialized society with irrational or anti-rational \\nbeliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud\\nto be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,\\njealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power\\nand authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting\\ntrends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and\\npolitical thinkers.

Many people in the company\\nwere directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had interests\\nthat were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquainting\\nthem with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation\\nof relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on the\\ntheory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would\\nbe a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake.\\nAlthough no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire\\nrange of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is\\nconcerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact that\\nall but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either as\\nemployees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDC\\nhas had no sustained project in machine translation.

For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed\\nthat the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information\\nretrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of\\nretrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that\\nbetween the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the\\nuse of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally,\\nin Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of\\ncharacterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument;\\nbut this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this,\\nor of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has\\nraged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of\\nmy main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios.\\n.X\\n26\\t1\\t176\\n30\\t1\\t176\\n51\\t3\\t176\\n57\\t2\\t176\\n61\\t1\\t176\\n69\\t1\\t176\\n71\\t2\\t176\\n73\\t1\\t176\\n75\\t1\\t176\\n77\\t2\\t176\\n79\\t1\\t176\\n114\\t1\\t176\\n144\\t1\\t176\\n168\\t1\\t176\\n175\\t6\\t176\\n176\\t16\\t176\\n315\\t1\\t176\\n327\\t1\\t176\\n329\\t1\\t176\\n363\\t1\\t176\\n382\\t1\\t176\\n419\\t3\\t176\\n434\\t1\\t176\\n446\\t1\\t176\\n448\\t2\\t176\\n458\\t2\\t176\\n480\\t1\\t176\\n483\\t2\\t176\\n484\\t1\\t176\\n486\\t1\\t176\\n488\\t3\\t176\\n491\\t1\\t176\\n493\\t1\\t176\\n499\\t1\\t176\\n500\\t1\\t176\\n503\\t1\\t176\\n507\\t1\\t176\\n509\\t4\\t176\\n510\\t1\\t176\\n512\\t1\\t176\\n517\\t2\\t176\\n520\\t1\\t176\\n522\\t2\\t176\\n527\\t2\\t176\\n528\\t1\\t176\\n531\\t1\\t176\\n565\\t5\\t176\\n566\\t2\\t176\\n570\\t1\\t176\\n572\\t1\\t176\\n576\\t1\\t176\\n577\\t2\\t176\\n581\\t1\\t176\\n595\\t1\\t176\\n596\\t4\\t176\\n603\\t1\\t176\\n608\\t2\\t176\\n619\\t1\\t176\\n633\\t1\\t176\\n644\\t1\\t176\\n659\\t2\\t176\\n660\\t2\\t176\\n661\\t1\\t176\\n662\\t2\\t176\\n664\\t1\\t176\\n715\\t1\\t176\\n754\\t1\\t176\\n785\\t1\\t176\\n790\\t1\\t176\\n805\\t1\\t176\\n809\\t1\\t176\\n810\\t2\\t176\\n812\\t3\\t176\\n813\\t2\\t176\\n814\\t2\\t176\\n817\\t1\\t176\\n824\\t2\\t176\\n825\\t1\\t176\\n830\\t1\\t176\\n870\\t1\\t176\\n894\\t2\\t176\\n928\\t1\\t176\\n963\\t1\\t176\\n990\\t1\\t176\\n991\\t1\\t176\\n1044\\t1\\t176\\n1051\\t1\\t176\\n1218\\t1\\t176\\n1255\\t1\\t176\\n1294\\t1\\t176\\n1307\\t1\\t176\\n1327\\t2\\t176\\n1413\\t1\\t176\\n1414\\t1\\t176\\n1419\\t1\\t176\\n1427\\t1\\t176\\n1445\\t1\\t176\\n1448\\t1\\t176\\n1448\\t1\\t176\\n.I 177\\n.T\\nAutomation in Libraries\\n.A\\nKimber, R.T.\\n.W\\n  My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding\\nof what automated systems can do in libraries today.

These areas of concern (well\\nknown to librarians) include mounting arrearages in\\ncataloguing and other processing activities; increasing\\ncomplexity of manual inventory control files;\\nincreasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues \\nreasonably current and accurate; and\\nincreasing demands for a wide variety of services\\nfor a clientele whose needs for information\\nhave grown tremendously since World War II,\\nand many of whom have only recently turned to\\nlarge research libraries for help.  Five years ago an\\ninternal committee of the Library of Congress was\\ncharged to study potential applications of electronic\\ndata processing equipment to Library procedures;\\nsubsequently representatives of three computer firms\\nmade brief studies of Library operations which \\nintimated that certain areas could benefit substantially\\nby automation.\\n.X\\n159\\t1\\t178\\n164\\t1\\t178\\n172\\t1\\t178\\n178\\t11\\t178\\n206\\t1\\t178\\n245\\t2\\t178\\n249\\t1\\t178\\n287\\t1\\t178\\n291\\t1\\t178\\n374\\t1\\t178\\n406\\t1\\t178\\n408\\t3\\t178\\n419\\t1\\t178\\n481\\t1\\t178\\n491\\t1\\t178\\n507\\t1\\t178\\n520\\t1\\t178\\n523\\t1\\t178\\n591\\t1\\t178\\n623\\t1\\t178\\n822\\t1\\t178\\n852\\t1\\t178\\n854\\t1\\t178\\n857\\t1\\t178\\n858\\t1\\t178\\n859\\t1\\t178\\n861\\t1\\t178\\n907\\t2\\t178\\n916\\t1\\t178\\n925\\t1\\t178\\n959\\t1\\t178\\n960\\t1\\t178\\n962\\t2\\t178\\n970\\t1\\t178\\n976\\t1\\t178\\n997\\t1\\t178\\n1007\\t2\\t178\\n1011\\t1\\t178\\n1033\\t1\\t178\\n1043\\t1\\t178\\n1071\\t1\\t178\\n1252\\t2\\t178\\n1317\\t1\\t178\\n1358\\t1\\t178\\n1371\\t1\\t178\\n1400\\t3\\t178\\n1400\\t3\\t178\\n.I 179\\n.T\\nAutomatic information, organization and retrieval\\n.A\\nSalton, G.\\n.W\\n    This book deals with the computer processing of large\\ninformation files, with special emphasis on automatic text handling methods.\\nDescribed in particular are procedures for dictionary construction and\\ndictionary look-up, statistical and syntactic language analysis methods,\\ninformation search and matching procedures, automatic information\\ndissemination systems, and methods for user interaction with the mechanized\\nsystem.

Automation\\ncan also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  In\\nall of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices are\\nanalysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role of\\nmachine is to considerably extend man\\'s capabilities rather than to\\ncompletely replace man. \\n  The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information\\nhave come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  These\\nsystems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.\\nThe physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,\\npunched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,\\nthe latter playing the most prominent part. \\n.X\\n78\\t1\\t180\\n179\\t1\\t180\\n180\\t6\\t180\\n363\\t1\\t180\\n572\\t1\\t180\\n683\\t1\\t180\\n1139\\t1\\t180\\n1168\\t1\\t180\\n1171\\t1\\t180\\n1409\\t1\\t180\\n1409\\t1\\t180\\n.I 181\\n.T\\nMedical School Library Statistics\\n.A\\nKeenan, E.L.\\n.W\\n  At the June 1962 Convention of the Medical Library Association in\\nChicago, Illinois, Mr. Stanley Truelson, now Librarian of the University of\\nRochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, circulated a petition\\nrequesting the collection and publication of medical school library\\nstatistics.  Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed the\\npetition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed \\nby Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group of\\nthe Medical Library Association.\\n  This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself,\\nstudied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Office\\nof Education.

This paper reports an investigation into use made of library books\\nby biomedical investigators.. Based on cancelled charge slips collected at the\\nYale Medical Library circulation desk, telephone appointments were made to\\ninterview those research investigators whose books has been returned the\\nprevious day.. The interviewer obtained answers from the investigator to a\\nquestionnaire to discover how the investigator had learned of a book, if the\\nbook had been useful, and, if useful, how it had been used.. During the \\nsix-month study period, 30.4 percent of researchers\\' volumes returned were\\nmonographs.. Almost four-fifths of books borrowed supplied information wanted,\\nand about four-fifths of books used had been printed in the previous decade..\\nNine-tenths of the use of books was research-related, the other tenth being\\nfor lecture preparation..\\n.X\\n31\\t1\\t184\\n33\\t2\\t184\\n36\\t5\\t184\\n41\\t2\\t184\\n42\\t1\\t184\\n46\\t1\\t184\\n57\\t1\\t184\\n76\\t1\\t184\\n89\\t2\\t184\\n90\\t1\\t184\\n97\\t1\\t184\\n102\\t1\\t184\\n111\\t1\\t184\\n112\\t1\\t184\\n161\\t1\\t184\\n163\\t1\\t184\\n181\\t2\\t184\\n182\\t2\\t184\\n183\\t7\\t184\\n184\\t11\\t184\\n193\\t6\\t184\\n195\\t2\\t184\\n198\\t2\\t184\\n199\\t2\\t184\\n201\\t5\\t184\\n202\\t2\\t184\\n203\\t6\\t184\\n204\\t5\\t184\\n205\\t3\\t184\\n209\\t1\\t184\\n210\\t1\\t184\\n212\\t1\\t184\\n217\\t1\\t184\\n220\\t1\\t184\\n222\\t1\\t184\\n225\\t1\\t184\\n233\\t1\\t184\\n267\\t1\\t184\\n269\\t2\\t184\\n284\\t1\\t184\\n286\\t1\\t184\\n294\\t1\\t184\\n359\\t1\\t184\\n373\\t1\\t184\\n395\\t2\\t184\\n415\\t1\\t184\\n543\\t1\\t184\\n545\\t1\\t184\\n552\\t3\\t184\\n587\\t2\\t184\\n588\\t1\\t184\\n605\\t1\\t184\\n613\\t2\\t184\\n614\\t1\\t184\\n624\\t1\\t184\\n638\\t1\\t184\\n667\\t1\\t184\\n735\\t2\\t184\\n747\\t1\\t184\\n748\\t1\\t184\\n750\\t2\\t184\\n751\\t1\\t184\\n753\\t1\\t184\\n759\\t1\\t184\\n760\\t1\\t184\\n765\\t1\\t184\\n766\\t2\\t184\\n767\\t3\\t184\\n774\\t1\\t184\\n775\\t1\\t184\\n778\\t2\\t184\\n782\\t1\\t184\\n783\\t1\\t184\\n784\\t2\\t184\\n787\\t1\\t184\\n788\\t1\\t184\\n789\\t1\\t184\\n791\\t1\\t184\\n792\\t1\\t184\\n793\\t2\\t184\\n799\\t1\\t184\\n800\\t3\\t184\\n808\\t2\\t184\\n828\\t1\\t184\\n891\\t1\\t184\\n905\\t2\\t184\\n952\\t1\\t184\\n953\\t2\\t184\\n959\\t1\\t184\\n964\\t1\\t184\\n968\\t1\\t184\\n977\\t1\\t184\\n983\\t1\\t184\\n1009\\t1\\t184\\n1016\\t1\\t184\\n1018\\t1\\t184\\n1019\\t1\\t184\\n1023\\t1\\t184\\n1030\\t1\\t184\\n1055\\t2\\t184\\n1081\\t1\\t184\\n1082\\t1\\t184\\n1083\\t1\\t184\\n1085\\t1\\t184\\n1086\\t1\\t184\\n1087\\t1\\t184\\n1090\\t1\\t184\\n1135\\t1\\t184\\n1151\\t1\\t184\\n1201\\t1\\t184\\n1240\\t1\\t184\\n1260\\t1\\t184\\n1275\\t1\\t184\\n1276\\t1\\t184\\n1278\\t2\\t184\\n1280\\t1\\t184\\n1285\\t1\\t184\\n1286\\t1\\t184\\n1287\\t1\\t184\\n1302\\t1\\t184\\n1335\\t1\\t184\\n1359\\t1\\t184\\n1390\\t1\\t184\\n1397\\t4\\t184\\n1401\\t1\\t184\\n1417\\t3\\t184\\n1418\\t1\\t184\\n1428\\t1\\t184\\n1432\\t2\\t184\\n1432\\t2\\t184\\n.I 185\\n.T\\nAn Investigation of the Educational Needs of Health Sciences Library\\nManpower:\\n  I.

Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary,\\njob mobility and preference for continuing education programs..\\n   Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were\\nnonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were \\nidentified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while\\nthe remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5\\nof all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force\\ntended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later\\nentry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was\\ncalculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male\\nnonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male\\nprofessionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic\\nmobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. In\\nexpressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science,\\nprofessionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization of\\nlibraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while \\nnonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing..\\n.X\\n185\\t3\\t188\\n186\\t3\\t188\\n187\\t3\\t188\\n188\\t5\\t188\\n188\\t5\\t188\\n.I 189\\n.T\\nSelected list of Books and Journals for the Small Medical Library\\n.A\\nBrandon, Alfred N.\\n.W\\n   This updated list of 410 books and 136 journals is intended as a selection\\naid for the small library of a hospital, medical society, clinic, or similar\\norganization..

The system, called AIM-TWX, was\\nsponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications\\nand utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California..\\nCitations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including\\nthose currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved\\neither on- or off-line..\\n   Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of\\nstaffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH\\nvocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog..\\n   The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately\\n200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run\\non any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an \\ninexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose\\ntraining schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was\\nhighly successful in terms of searches and citations..\\n   At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors,\\nand  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no \\ncitations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest\\namong the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large\\nnumber of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia\\nparticipated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand\\nfor this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with\\ngreat rapidity..\\n.X\\n66\\t1\\t197\\n120\\t1\\t197\\n124\\t1\\t197\\n127\\t1\\t197\\n129\\t1\\t197\\n161\\t1\\t197\\n190\\t1\\t197\\n191\\t1\\t197\\n197\\t5\\t197\\n211\\t1\\t197\\n214\\t1\\t197\\n218\\t2\\t197\\n243\\t1\\t197\\n307\\t1\\t197\\n330\\t1\\t197\\n332\\t1\\t197\\n375\\t1\\t197\\n378\\t1\\t197\\n382\\t1\\t197\\n445\\t1\\t197\\n450\\t1\\t197\\n451\\t1\\t197\\n452\\t1\\t197\\n454\\t1\\t197\\n459\\t1\\t197\\n468\\t1\\t197\\n472\\t1\\t197\\n484\\t1\\t197\\n492\\t1\\t197\\n503\\t1\\t197\\n506\\t2\\t197\\n507\\t1\\t197\\n508\\t1\\t197\\n511\\t1\\t197\\n512\\t1\\t197\\n514\\t1\\t197\\n518\\t1\\t197\\n520\\t1\\t197\\n523\\t1\\t197\\n524\\t1\\t197\\n525\\t1\\t197\\n526\\t1\\t197\\n529\\t1\\t197\\n530\\t1\\t197\\n534\\t1\\t197\\n546\\t2\\t197\\n553\\t1\\t197\\n554\\t1\\t197\\n579\\t2\\t197\\n591\\t1\\t197\\n593\\t2\\t197\\n594\\t3\\t197\\n595\\t1\\t197\\n596\\t1\\t197\\n597\\t1\\t197\\n599\\t1\\t197\\n600\\t1\\t197\\n603\\t2\\t197\\n604\\t2\\t197\\n606\\t3\\t197\\n609\\t1\\t197\\n610\\t1\\t197\\n611\\t1\\t197\\n612\\t1\\t197\\n625\\t1\\t197\\n626\\t1\\t197\\n630\\t1\\t197\\n634\\t1\\t197\\n636\\t1\\t197\\n637\\t1\\t197\\n642\\t1\\t197\\n648\\t1\\t197\\n650\\t1\\t197\\n692\\t1\\t197\\n696\\t2\\t197\\n699\\t1\\t197\\n703\\t1\\t197\\n705\\t2\\t197\\n708\\t1\\t197\\n723\\t1\\t197\\n724\\t1\\t197\\n726\\t1\\t197\\n727\\t1\\t197\\n728\\t1\\t197\\n731\\t1\\t197\\n732\\t1\\t197\\n733\\t1\\t197\\n734\\t1\\t197\\n736\\t2\\t197\\n738\\t1\\t197\\n739\\t1\\t197\\n740\\t1\\t197\\n741\\t1\\t197\\n742\\t1\\t197\\n743\\t1\\t197\\n744\\t1\\t197\\n755\\t1\\t197\\n795\\t1\\t197\\n801\\t1\\t197\\n805\\t1\\t197\\n806\\t1\\t197\\n820\\t1\\t197\\n826\\t2\\t197\\n827\\t1\\t197\\n836\\t1\\t197\\n866\\t1\\t197\\n867\\t1\\t197\\n879\\t1\\t197\\n883\\t1\\t197\\n956\\t1\\t197\\n989\\t1\\t197\\n1004\\t1\\t197\\n1035\\t2\\t197\\n1078\\t1\\t197\\n1089\\t1\\t197\\n1091\\t1\\t197\\n1207\\t1\\t197\\n1264\\t1\\t197\\n1297\\t1\\t197\\n1298\\t1\\t197\\n1299\\t1\\t197\\n1303\\t1\\t197\\n1327\\t1\\t197\\n1356\\t1\\t197\\n1364\\t1\\t197\\n1368\\t1\\t197\\n1370\\t1\\t197\\n1372\\t1\\t197\\n1373\\t1\\t197\\n1374\\t1\\t197\\n1375\\t1\\t197\\n1376\\t1\\t197\\n1377\\t1\\t197\\n1405\\t1\\t197\\n1405\\t1\\t197\\n.I 198\\n.T\\nChoosing Physiology Journals\\n.A\\nBrodman, E.\\n.W\\n  For many years administrators of library collections have sought\\nobjective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections\\nin the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest\\napproach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge\\nof the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This\\nmethod consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at\\nthe conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under\\nconsideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the\\nfrequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the \\nreferences in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and\\na list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross\\nand Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the\\nAmerican Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library\\nto purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.\\n  Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty\\nyears, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have\\nnever been examined.  These assumptions are:\\n1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct\\n   proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional\\n   literature.\\n2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are\\n   representative of the entire field.\\n3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted\\n   equally.\\n.X\\n31\\t1\\t198\\n33\\t1\\t198\\n36\\t2\\t198\\n37\\t1\\t198\\n41\\t2\\t198\\n46\\t1\\t198\\n76\\t1\\t198\\n89\\t1\\t198\\n181\\t1\\t198\\n182\\t1\\t198\\n183\\t2\\t198\\n184\\t2\\t198\\n185\\t1\\t198\\n193\\t2\\t198\\n195\\t2\\t198\\n196\\t1\\t198\\n198\\t8\\t198\\n199\\t1\\t198\\n201\\t3\\t198\\n203\\t1\\t198\\n204\\t1\\t198\\n211\\t1\\t198\\n217\\t1\\t198\\n220\\t1\\t198\\n269\\t1\\t198\\n361\\t1\\t198\\n379\\t1\\t198\\n395\\t1\\t198\\n415\\t1\\t198\\n543\\t1\\t198\\n545\\t1\\t198\\n552\\t1\\t198\\n588\\t1\\t198\\n614\\t1\\t198\\n616\\t2\\t198\\n632\\t1\\t198\\n635\\t1\\t198\\n638\\t1\\t198\\n685\\t1\\t198\\n735\\t3\\t198\\n760\\t1\\t198\\n766\\t1\\t198\\n767\\t1\\t198\\n774\\t1\\t198\\n775\\t1\\t198\\n778\\t1\\t198\\n784\\t1\\t198\\n789\\t1\\t198\\n821\\t1\\t198\\n828\\t1\\t198\\n831\\t1\\t198\\n891\\t2\\t198\\n905\\t2\\t198\\n952\\t2\\t198\\n953\\t1\\t198\\n964\\t1\\t198\\n968\\t1\\t198\\n1009\\t1\\t198\\n1018\\t1\\t198\\n1019\\t1\\t198\\n1055\\t1\\t198\\n1071\\t1\\t198\\n1147\\t1\\t198\\n1210\\t1\\t198\\n1240\\t1\\t198\\n1260\\t1\\t198\\n1275\\t5\\t198\\n1276\\t1\\t198\\n1290\\t1\\t198\\n1302\\t4\\t198\\n1355\\t1\\t198\\n1359\\t1\\t198\\n1397\\t3\\t198\\n1417\\t1\\t198\\n1432\\t1\\t198\\n1432\\t1\\t198\\n.I 199\\n.T\\nStatistical Bibliography in the Health Sciences\\n.A\\nRaisig, L.M.\\n.W\\n  The sustained interest in documentation, as a key to the retrieval of\\ninformation in the literature of the sciences, has obscured largely the\\npotential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzing\\ninformation needs.

Titles of sixty-seven journals\\nwhich supplied slightly more than 50 percent of use are listed..\\n.X\\n31\\t3\\t201\\n33\\t1\\t201\\n36\\t4\\t201\\n41\\t1\\t201\\n46\\t1\\t201\\n57\\t1\\t201\\n76\\t1\\t201\\n89\\t1\\t201\\n90\\t1\\t201\\n121\\t1\\t201\\n161\\t1\\t201\\n181\\t2\\t201\\n182\\t2\\t201\\n183\\t5\\t201\\n184\\t5\\t201\\n185\\t1\\t201\\n189\\t1\\t201\\n193\\t7\\t201\\n195\\t3\\t201\\n196\\t2\\t201\\n198\\t3\\t201\\n199\\t1\\t201\\n201\\t16\\t201\\n202\\t1\\t201\\n203\\t6\\t201\\n204\\t5\\t201\\n205\\t4\\t201\\n209\\t1\\t201\\n210\\t1\\t201\\n211\\t1\\t201\\n212\\t1\\t201\\n217\\t2\\t201\\n219\\t1\\t201\\n220\\t2\\t201\\n222\\t1\\t201\\n233\\t1\\t201\\n267\\t1\\t201\\n269\\t2\\t201\\n284\\t1\\t201\\n286\\t1\\t201\\n294\\t1\\t201\\n359\\t2\\t201\\n373\\t3\\t201\\n379\\t1\\t201\\n395\\t2\\t201\\n415\\t1\\t201\\n475\\t1\\t201\\n543\\t1\\t201\\n552\\t1\\t201\\n554\\t1\\t201\\n587\\t1\\t201\\n588\\t1\\t201\\n613\\t1\\t201\\n614\\t1\\t201\\n624\\t1\\t201\\n638\\t1\\t201\\n667\\t1\\t201\\n735\\t1\\t201\\n748\\t2\\t201\\n750\\t1\\t201\\n751\\t1\\t201\\n759\\t1\\t201\\n760\\t1\\t201\\n765\\t1\\t201\\n766\\t1\\t201\\n767\\t3\\t201\\n774\\t1\\t201\\n778\\t2\\t201\\n784\\t1\\t201\\n787\\t1\\t201\\n791\\t1\\t201\\n792\\t1\\t201\\n793\\t1\\t201\\n799\\t1\\t201\\n800\\t2\\t201\\n808\\t1\\t201\\n821\\t2\\t201\\n828\\t1\\t201\\n889\\t1\\t201\\n891\\t2\\t201\\n905\\t2\\t201\\n952\\t1\\t201\\n953\\t1\\t201\\n959\\t1\\t201\\n964\\t1\\t201\\n968\\t1\\t201\\n977\\t3\\t201\\n1009\\t1\\t201\\n1018\\t1\\t201\\n1019\\t2\\t201\\n1055\\t1\\t201\\n1081\\t1\\t201\\n1082\\t1\\t201\\n1083\\t1\\t201\\n1085\\t1\\t201\\n1086\\t2\\t201\\n1151\\t1\\t201\\n1173\\t1\\t201\\n1201\\t1\\t201\\n1203\\t3\\t201\\n1240\\t1\\t201\\n1256\\t1\\t201\\n1275\\t2\\t201\\n1278\\t1\\t201\\n1302\\t1\\t201\\n1352\\t3\\t201\\n1355\\t1\\t201\\n1359\\t1\\t201\\n1369\\t2\\t201\\n1397\\t5\\t201\\n1401\\t1\\t201\\n1417\\t2\\t201\\n1418\\t1\\t201\\n1432\\t1\\t201\\n1451\\t1\\t201\\n1451\\t1\\t201\\n.I 202\\n.T\\nMedical Libraries and the Assessment of User Needs\\n.A\\nRees, Alan M.\\n.W\\n   Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great\\ndetail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and\\nsearching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing\\nfor this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and \\nunstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..\\n   Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow,\\nthe subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction\\nproduced by present information services and does not yield insight into the\\nextent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the\\nresponse of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs,\\nsince questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of \\nunderlying information needs..\\n   Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system\\nmust, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of\\nbiomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which\\ncan explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors..\\nSignificant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals\\nsuch as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to\\nenvironment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical\\npractitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their\\ncolleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical\\nschools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..\\n   It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a\\nmethodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the\\ninformation needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t202\\n33\\t1\\t202\\n34\\t1\\t202\\n36\\t1\\t202\\n42\\t1\\t202\\n49\\t1\\t202\\n53\\t1\\t202\\n59\\t1\\t202\\n90\\t1\\t202\\n132\\t1\\t202\\n161\\t1\\t202\\n164\\t1\\t202\\n183\\t1\\t202\\n184\\t2\\t202\\n193\\t2\\t202\\n199\\t1\\t202\\n201\\t1\\t202\\n202\\t6\\t202\\n203\\t2\\t202\\n204\\t1\\t202\\n205\\t1\\t202\\n209\\t1\\t202\\n210\\t1\\t202\\n212\\t1\\t202\\n213\\t1\\t202\\n217\\t1\\t202\\n220\\t1\\t202\\n222\\t1\\t202\\n224\\t1\\t202\\n243\\t1\\t202\\n284\\t1\\t202\\n286\\t1\\t202\\n294\\t1\\t202\\n421\\t1\\t202\\n465\\t1\\t202\\n466\\t1\\t202\\n490\\t1\\t202\\n491\\t1\\t202\\n506\\t1\\t202\\n507\\t1\\t202\\n510\\t1\\t202\\n512\\t1\\t202\\n543\\t1\\t202\\n588\\t1\\t202\\n591\\t1\\t202\\n595\\t1\\t202\\n603\\t1\\t202\\n604\\t1\\t202\\n613\\t1\\t202\\n622\\t1\\t202\\n623\\t1\\t202\\n624\\t1\\t202\\n629\\t1\\t202\\n633\\t1\\t202\\n639\\t1\\t202\\n659\\t1\\t202\\n676\\t1\\t202\\n711\\t1\\t202\\n722\\t1\\t202\\n723\\t1\\t202\\n726\\t1\\t202\\n728\\t1\\t202\\n730\\t1\\t202\\n731\\t1\\t202\\n732\\t1\\t202\\n799\\t1\\t202\\n800\\t1\\t202\\n808\\t1\\t202\\n809\\t1\\t202\\n810\\t1\\t202\\n813\\t1\\t202\\n814\\t1\\t202\\n820\\t1\\t202\\n822\\t1\\t202\\n828\\t1\\t202\\n870\\t1\\t202\\n879\\t1\\t202\\n891\\t1\\t202\\n928\\t1\\t202\\n959\\t1\\t202\\n965\\t1\\t202\\n973\\t1\\t202\\n1091\\t1\\t202\\n1151\\t1\\t202\\n1283\\t1\\t202\\n1298\\t1\\t202\\n1299\\t1\\t202\\n1363\\t1\\t202\\n1366\\t1\\t202\\n1367\\t1\\t202\\n1368\\t1\\t202\\n1396\\t1\\t202\\n1396\\t1\\t202\\n.I 203\\n.T\\nAnalysis of Recorded Biomedical Book and Journal Use in the Yale Medical\\nLibrary\\nPart I.

It fails utterly to report or even to\\nsuggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources..

Measuring a Library\\'s Capability for Providing Documents\\n.A\\nOrr, Richard H.\\n.A\\nPings, Vern M.\\n.A\\nPizer, Irwin H.\\n.A\\nOlson, Edwin E.\\n.A\\nSpencer, Carol C.\\n.W\\n   A method of measuring a library\\'s capability for providing the documents its\\nusers need has been developed.. The library is tested with representative \\nsample of such documents to determine how long would be required for users to\\nobtain these documents.. Test results are expressed in terms of a Capability\\nIndex, which has a maximal value of 100 only if all the sample documents are\\nfound \"on shelf\".. Specific tests employing samples of 300 documents have been\\ndeveloped that are appropriate for academic an for \"reservoir\" biomedical\\nlibraries.. Realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests are\\npractical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible..\\nWhen strict comparability is not important, a library can test itself.. In\\nassessing a reservoir library, test results are supplemented by data on its\\ntypical processing time for interlibrary loan requests.. Currently these tests\\nare being used in a national survey.. The general method is applicable to other\\ntypes of libraries, provided appropriate test samples are established.. If \\ntheir limitations are clearly understood, these \"Document Delivery Tests\"\\ncan be valuable tools for planning and managing library services..\\n.X\\n4\\t2\\t207\\n5\\t1\\t207\\n9\\t2\\t207\\n31\\t1\\t207\\n32\\t1\\t207\\n46\\t1\\t207\\n61\\t1\\t207\\n67\\t1\\t207\\n70\\t1\\t207\\n71\\t1\\t207\\n72\\t1\\t207\\n73\\t1\\t207\\n96\\t1\\t207\\n131\\t1\\t207\\n133\\t1\\t207\\n135\\t1\\t207\\n136\\t1\\t207\\n137\\t1\\t207\\n153\\t1\\t207\\n163\\t1\\t207\\n175\\t1\\t207\\n181\\t2\\t207\\n206\\t7\\t207\\n207\\t17\\t207\\n208\\t6\\t207\\n217\\t2\\t207\\n222\\t1\\t207\\n223\\t1\\t207\\n234\\t2\\t207\\n245\\t2\\t207\\n266\\t2\\t207\\n270\\t1\\t207\\n272\\t1\\t207\\n277\\t1\\t207\\n282\\t1\\t207\\n296\\t1\\t207\\n297\\t1\\t207\\n298\\t1\\t207\\n300\\t1\\t207\\n301\\t1\\t207\\n302\\t1\\t207\\n358\\t1\\t207\\n364\\t2\\t207\\n382\\t1\\t207\\n408\\t1\\t207\\n456\\t1\\t207\\n458\\t2\\t207\\n481\\t1\\t207\\n483\\t1\\t207\\n485\\t1\\t207\\n502\\t2\\t207\\n515\\t1\\t207\\n535\\t1\\t207\\n549\\t1\\t207\\n625\\t1\\t207\\n629\\t1\\t207\\n631\\t1\\t207\\n634\\t1\\t207\\n638\\t2\\t207\\n748\\t1\\t207\\n764\\t1\\t207\\n766\\t1\\t207\\n768\\t1\\t207\\n774\\t1\\t207\\n779\\t1\\t207\\n780\\t1\\t207\\n783\\t1\\t207\\n791\\t1\\t207\\n799\\t1\\t207\\n811\\t7\\t207\\n816\\t4\\t207\\n818\\t1\\t207\\n823\\t1\\t207\\n843\\t1\\t207\\n844\\t1\\t207\\n846\\t1\\t207\\n891\\t1\\t207\\n913\\t1\\t207\\n915\\t1\\t207\\n925\\t4\\t207\\n939\\t1\\t207\\n948\\t1\\t207\\n959\\t1\\t207\\n960\\t1\\t207\\n961\\t3\\t207\\n962\\t3\\t207\\n963\\t1\\t207\\n964\\t5\\t207\\n968\\t1\\t207\\n976\\t1\\t207\\n981\\t1\\t207\\n982\\t1\\t207\\n994\\t1\\t207\\n1005\\t1\\t207\\n1015\\t1\\t207\\n1068\\t1\\t207\\n1203\\t1\\t207\\n1205\\t1\\t207\\n1242\\t1\\t207\\n1247\\t1\\t207\\n1268\\t1\\t207\\n1317\\t2\\t207\\n1321\\t1\\t207\\n1354\\t1\\t207\\n1358\\t1\\t207\\n1400\\t2\\t207\\n1402\\t1\\t207\\n1407\\t2\\t207\\n1410\\t1\\t207\\n1417\\t1\\t207\\n1445\\t1\\t207\\n1445\\t1\\t207\\n.I 208\\n.T\\nDevelopment of Methodologic Tools for Planning and\\nManaging Library Services:\\nIII. Standardized Inventories of Library Services\\n.A\\nOrr, Richard H.\\n.A\\nPings, Vern M.\\n.A\\nOlson, Edwin E.\\n.A\\nPizer, Irwin H.\\n.W\\n   A standardized procedure was developed for eliciting those details for a\\nlibrary\\'s service policies that are important to its users and for recording\\nthe data by checking appropriate categories on a form.. This inventory \\nprocedure covers the entire spectrum of user services and accommodates a wide\\nrange of policies.. The inventory was originally designed for use by trained\\ninterviewers in large-scale surveys of academic medical libraries.. However,\\nit is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide and\\nChecklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to \\nsurvey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative,\\nmanagerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categorical\\ninventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes \\nit possible to calculate scores indicating how a library\\'s policies compare\\nwith those of an \"optimal\" library.. An analogous inventory of the services a \\nlibrary provides to other libraries was developed for surveying major backup\\nresources in the medical library system..\\n.X\\n31\\t1\\t208\\n46\\t1\\t208\\n61\\t1\\t208\\n67\\t1\\t208\\n70\\t1\\t208\\n71\\t1\\t208\\n72\\t1\\t208\\n73\\t1\\t208\\n135\\t1\\t208\\n175\\t1\\t208\\n181\\t2\\t208\\n206\\t8\\t208\\n207\\t6\\t208\\n208\\t12\\t208\\n217\\t2\\t208\\n222\\t1\\t208\\n223\\t1\\t208\\n245\\t1\\t208\\n266\\t2\\t208\\n270\\t1\\t208\\n272\\t1\\t208\\n277\\t1\\t208\\n282\\t1\\t208\\n358\\t1\\t208\\n382\\t1\\t208\\n385\\t1\\t208\\n408\\t2\\t208\\n415\\t1\\t208\\n458\\t1\\t208\\n481\\t1\\t208\\n483\\t1\\t208\\n485\\t1\\t208\\n591\\t1\\t208\\n748\\t1\\t208\\n779\\t1\\t208\\n780\\t1\\t208\\n816\\t1\\t208\\n891\\t1\\t208\\n925\\t2\\t208\\n962\\t1\\t208\\n964\\t3\\t208\\n970\\t1\\t208\\n976\\t2\\t208\\n981\\t1\\t208\\n982\\t1\\t208\\n1005\\t2\\t208\\n1007\\t1\\t208\\n1018\\t1\\t208\\n1056\\t1\\t208\\n1205\\t1\\t208\\n1317\\t2\\t208\\n1358\\t1\\t208\\n1384\\t1\\t208\\n1400\\t1\\t208\\n1402\\t1\\t208\\n1407\\t1\\t208\\n1410\\t1\\t208\\n1417\\t1\\t208\\n1417\\t1\\t208\\n.I 209\\n.T\\nSurvey of the Card Catalog in Medical Libraries\\n.A\\nPachefsky, Reva\\n.W\\n   A survey of present uses and arrangement of medical library card catalogs \\nwas made in order to determine current practices and trends.. Attention was\\nfocused on the influences of MeSH on the card catalog.. The results indicate\\nthat the prevalent type of card catalog found in medical libraries is the \\ndivided catalog.. In addition, it appears that this catalog arrangement is \\ngaining acceptance, and the trend is toward division..

For the whole sample, citation list in \\nperiodical articles were the principal sources of references, although for\\nliterature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexing\\njournals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be the\\nmost fruitful source of references..

Specific examples of how \\nlibrarians can best serve the information needs of scientists using SDI systems\\nare examined.. It is the basic contention of this paper that the librarian\\nshould serve as an intermediary between users and the numerous new information\\nmedia..

Selected aspects of the descriptive data \\nobtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and \\ncommented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest \\nthat increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the \\npast two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of \\nservice, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of\\nservices.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the \\ndescriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the\\nweighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians\\nto reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..\\nOne these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services\\nrelative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single\\nfigure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to \\n87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some \\nexploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find \\nexplanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical\\nregions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey\\ndata for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most\\nimportant of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - \\nactivities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and\\nrecommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate \\nfor the Medical Library Association..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t217\\n36\\t2\\t217\\n90\\t1\\t217\\n161\\t1\\t217\\n172\\t1\\t217\\n181\\t1\\t217\\n183\\t1\\t217\\n184\\t1\\t217\\n185\\t1\\t217\\n193\\t1\\t217\\n198\\t1\\t217\\n199\\t1\\t217\\n201\\t2\\t217\\n202\\t1\\t217\\n203\\t1\\t217\\n204\\t1\\t217\\n205\\t1\\t217\\n206\\t1\\t217\\n207\\t2\\t217\\n208\\t2\\t217\\n209\\t1\\t217\\n211\\t2\\t217\\n212\\t1\\t217\\n214\\t1\\t217\\n216\\t1\\t217\\n217\\t8\\t217\\n218\\t1\\t217\\n220\\t3\\t217\\n222\\t2\\t217\\n223\\t1\\t217\\n243\\t1\\t217\\n249\\t1\\t217\\n284\\t1\\t217\\n286\\t1\\t217\\n294\\t1\\t217\\n364\\t1\\t217\\n385\\t1\\t217\\n502\\t1\\t217\\n543\\t1\\t217\\n588\\t1\\t217\\n591\\t1\\t217\\n598\\t1\\t217\\n613\\t1\\t217\\n624\\t1\\t217\\n748\\t1\\t217\\n779\\t1\\t217\\n799\\t1\\t217\\n800\\t1\\t217\\n808\\t1\\t217\\n811\\t1\\t217\\n816\\t1\\t217\\n891\\t3\\t217\\n959\\t1\\t217\\n962\\t1\\t217\\n964\\t1\\t217\\n1030\\t1\\t217\\n1147\\t1\\t217\\n1151\\t1\\t217\\n1275\\t1\\t217\\n1397\\t1\\t217\\n1403\\t1\\t217\\n1403\\t1\\t217\\n.I 218\\n.T\\nThe National Biomedical Communications Network as a Developing Structure\\n.A\\nDavis, Ruth M.\\n.W\\n   The National Biomedical Communications Network has evolved both from a set \\nof conceptual recommendations over the last twelve years and an accumulation\\nof needs manifesting themselves in the requests of members of the medical \\ncommunity..

The advantages and disadvantages of each method of \\nmeasurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the \\nanalysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the \\nrationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead\\nto a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the \\npurpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely \\nconsidered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather\\nthan as part of the whole.. Third, the library\\'s preservation function has not\\nbeen considered at all..\\n.X\\n5\\t1\\t222\\n9\\t1\\t222\\n33\\t1\\t222\\n36\\t1\\t222\\n90\\t2\\t222\\n91\\t1\\t222\\n158\\t1\\t222\\n161\\t1\\t222\\n183\\t1\\t222\\n184\\t1\\t222\\n193\\t1\\t222\\n199\\t1\\t222\\n201\\t1\\t222\\n202\\t1\\t222\\n203\\t1\\t222\\n204\\t1\\t222\\n205\\t1\\t222\\n207\\t1\\t222\\n208\\t1\\t222\\n209\\t1\\t222\\n212\\t1\\t222\\n217\\t2\\t222\\n220\\t1\\t222\\n222\\t7\\t222\\n223\\t4\\t222\\n267\\t1\\t222\\n284\\t1\\t222\\n286\\t1\\t222\\n294\\t1\\t222\\n296\\t1\\t222\\n297\\t1\\t222\\n298\\t1\\t222\\n300\\t1\\t222\\n301\\t1\\t222\\n302\\t1\\t222\\n358\\t1\\t222\\n364\\t1\\t222\\n368\\t1\\t222\\n435\\t1\\t222\\n494\\t1\\t222\\n515\\t2\\t222\\n535\\t1\\t222\\n543\\t1\\t222\\n587\\t1\\t222\\n588\\t1\\t222\\n591\\t1\\t222\\n613\\t1\\t222\\n615\\t1\\t222\\n624\\t1\\t222\\n625\\t1\\t222\\n629\\t1\\t222\\n631\\t1\\t222\\n634\\t1\\t222\\n791\\t1\\t222\\n792\\t2\\t222\\n799\\t1\\t222\\n800\\t1\\t222\\n808\\t1\\t222\\n811\\t1\\t222\\n815\\t2\\t222\\n816\\t2\\t222\\n818\\t1\\t222\\n823\\t2\\t222\\n840\\t1\\t222\\n843\\t1\\t222\\n844\\t1\\t222\\n846\\t1\\t222\\n915\\t1\\t222\\n925\\t1\\t222\\n945\\t1\\t222\\n948\\t1\\t222\\n957\\t1\\t222\\n959\\t1\\t222\\n961\\t1\\t222\\n962\\t2\\t222\\n964\\t2\\t222\\n994\\t1\\t222\\n1015\\t1\\t222\\n1023\\t1\\t222\\n1151\\t1\\t222\\n1219\\t2\\t222\\n1227\\t1\\t222\\n1242\\t1\\t222\\n1247\\t1\\t222\\n1268\\t1\\t222\\n1324\\t1\\t222\\n1354\\t1\\t222\\n1365\\t1\\t222\\n1390\\t1\\t222\\n1416\\t1\\t222\\n1417\\t1\\t222\\n1417\\t1\\t222\\n.I 223\\n.T\\nDocument Delivery Capabilities of Major Biomedical Libraries in 1968:\\nResults of a National Survey Employing Standardized Tests\\n.A\\nOrr, Richard H.\\n.A\\nSchless, Arthur P.\\n.W\\n   The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT\\'s) developed earlier (Bulletin\\n56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two\\nmedical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical \\nresearchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling \\nI-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized \\nas statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in\\nthe test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the \\nmean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..\\nA mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,\\nas seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded\\nby its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, \\nprocessing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain\\nrealized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular \\nlibrary, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables \\ncan be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status \\nstatistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions \\nof basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this \\nwork is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision \\naids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and \\nfurther development of DDT\\'s is recommended as appropriate for the Medical \\nLibrary Association..\\n.X\\n5\\t1\\t223\\n9\\t1\\t223\\n14\\t1\\t223\\n90\\t1\\t223\\n91\\t1\\t223\\n128\\t1\\t223\\n129\\t1\\t223\\n130\\t1\\t223\\n153\\t1\\t223\\n158\\t1\\t223\\n167\\t1\\t223\\n170\\t1\\t223\\n207\\t1\\t223\\n208\\t1\\t223\\n217\\t1\\t223\\n222\\t4\\t223\\n223\\t6\\t223\\n225\\t1\\t223\\n234\\t1\\t223\\n266\\t1\\t223\\n271\\t1\\t223\\n280\\t1\\t223\\n296\\t1\\t223\\n297\\t1\\t223\\n298\\t1\\t223\\n300\\t1\\t223\\n301\\t1\\t223\\n302\\t1\\t223\\n358\\t1\\t223\\n364\\t1\\t223\\n368\\t1\\t223\\n393\\t1\\t223\\n435\\t1\\t223\\n468\\t1\\t223\\n494\\t1\\t223\\n515\\t1\\t223\\n535\\t1\\t223\\n550\\t1\\t223\\n591\\t1\\t223\\n615\\t1\\t223\\n625\\t1\\t223\\n629\\t1\\t223\\n631\\t1\\t223\\n634\\t1\\t223\\n639\\t1\\t223\\n646\\t1\\t223\\n647\\t1\\t223\\n651\\t1\\t223\\n765\\t1\\t223\\n791\\t1\\t223\\n792\\t1\\t223\\n811\\t1\\t223\\n815\\t2\\t223\\n816\\t2\\t223\\n818\\t2\\t223\\n822\\t1\\t223\\n823\\t2\\t223\\n827\\t1\\t223\\n843\\t1\\t223\\n844\\t1\\t223\\n846\\t1\\t223\\n915\\t1\\t223\\n925\\t1\\t223\\n943\\t1\\t223\\n944\\t1\\t223\\n945\\t1\\t223\\n957\\t1\\t223\\n961\\t1\\t223\\n962\\t2\\t223\\n964\\t2\\t223\\n994\\t1\\t223\\n1015\\t1\\t223\\n1019\\t1\\t223\\n1023\\t1\\t223\\n1028\\t1\\t223\\n1070\\t1\\t223\\n1085\\t1\\t223\\n1086\\t1\\t223\\n1090\\t1\\t223\\n1219\\t1\\t223\\n1227\\t1\\t223\\n1242\\t1\\t223\\n1247\\t1\\t223\\n1268\\t1\\t223\\n1354\\t1\\t223\\n1365\\t1\\t223\\n1374\\t1\\t223\\n1390\\t2\\t223\\n1401\\t1\\t223\\n1424\\t1\\t223\\n1437\\t1\\t223\\n1437\\t1\\t223\\n.I 224\\n.T\\nThe Implementation, Evaluation, and Refinement of a Manual SDI Service \\n.A\\nYunis, Susan S.\\n.W\\n   The Missouri Institute of Psychiatry Library has implemented an inexpensive,\\nmanual SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) service based upon the \\nmonthly issues of Index Medicus..

A basis for\\nsuch a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley\\non this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a\\nnumber of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and\\nthe savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message\\nand due to the nature of the final destination of the information.\\n  The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at\\none point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another\\npoint.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are \\ncorrelated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual\\nentities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the\\nengineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is\\none selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed\\nto operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually\\nbe chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. \\n.X\\n19\\t2\\t228\\n73\\t1\\t228\\n149\\t1\\t228\\n175\\t1\\t228\\n228\\t18\\t228\\n229\\t10\\t228\\n318\\t1\\t228\\n321\\t3\\t228\\n324\\t1\\t228\\n329\\t3\\t228\\n359\\t1\\t228\\n389\\t1\\t228\\n390\\t1\\t228\\n416\\t3\\t228\\n442\\t3\\t228\\n450\\t2\\t228\\n469\\t1\\t228\\n494\\t1\\t228\\n495\\t2\\t228\\n505\\t1\\t228\\n511\\t3\\t228\\n521\\t1\\t228\\n524\\t3\\t228\\n536\\t1\\t228\\n540\\t1\\t228\\n563\\t1\\t228\\n565\\t1\\t228\\n567\\t1\\t228\\n574\\t1\\t228\\n587\\t1\\t228\\n599\\t1\\t228\\n700\\t1\\t228\\n750\\t1\\t228\\n751\\t1\\t228\\n792\\t1\\t228\\n803\\t1\\t228\\n804\\t1\\t228\\n835\\t2\\t228\\n851\\t2\\t228\\n862\\t2\\t228\\n867\\t2\\t228\\n875\\t1\\t228\\n1082\\t2\\t228\\n1085\\t1\\t228\\n1086\\t1\\t228\\n1194\\t3\\t228\\n1199\\t3\\t228\\n1224\\t1\\t228\\n1232\\t1\\t228\\n1274\\t1\\t228\\n1282\\t1\\t228\\n1313\\t1\\t228\\n1396\\t1\\t228\\n1398\\t1\\t228\\n1398\\t1\\t228\\n.I 229\\n.T\\nA Mathematical Theory of Communication\\n.A\\nShannon, C.E.\\n.W\\n  In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the\\nsignals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with\\nthe discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the\\ncontinuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete\\ncase by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite\\nnumber of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on\\na discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in\\ngeneral approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There\\nare, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of\\nemphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to\\nparticular cases.\\n  We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with\\nthe greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since\\nthis would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would\\nobscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however,\\nindicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and\\nrigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and\\nmany others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the\\npresent analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t229\\n73\\t1\\t229\\n149\\t1\\t229\\n175\\t1\\t229\\n228\\t10\\t229\\n229\\t10\\t229\\n321\\t1\\t229\\n329\\t1\\t229\\n359\\t1\\t229\\n469\\t1\\t229\\n494\\t1\\t229\\n521\\t1\\t229\\n540\\t1\\t229\\n574\\t1\\t229\\n587\\t1\\t229\\n700\\t1\\t229\\n750\\t1\\t229\\n751\\t1\\t229\\n792\\t1\\t229\\n804\\t1\\t229\\n867\\t1\\t229\\n1082\\t1\\t229\\n1085\\t1\\t229\\n1086\\t1\\t229\\n1199\\t1\\t229\\n1224\\t1\\t229\\n1232\\t1\\t229\\n1274\\t1\\t229\\n1282\\t1\\t229\\n1313\\t1\\t229\\n1313\\t1\\t229\\n.I 230\\n.T\\nBetween MLS and PhD; a Study of Sixth-Year Specialist Programs\\nin Accredited Library Schools\\n.A\\nDanton, J.P.\\n.W\\n  The intent of this survey is to describe educational practice\\n(to spring 1969) in the emerging sixth-year specialist\\nprograms in library schools accredited by the American Library\\nAssociation.\\n.X\\n22\\t1\\t230\\n171\\t1\\t230\\n230\\t5\\t230\\n339\\t1\\t230\\n387\\t1\\t230\\n896\\t1\\t230\\n934\\t1\\t230\\n954\\t1\\t230\\n1403\\t1\\t230\\n1423\\t2\\t230\\n1423\\t2\\t230\\n.I 231\\n.T\\nBibliographic Control of Nonprint Media\\n.A\\nGrove, P.S.\\n.W\\n  Educational systems specialists lament the\\ndeplorable lack of organization of nonprint\\nmedia for utilization in the learning process.\\nAudiovisual personnel have, out of despair,\\nmade a painful entry into the world of\\nbibliography while librarians, long experienced\\nin the bibliographic control of printed matter,\\nstill appear preoccupied with more conventional\\nforms of information and reluctant to turn\\ntheir expertise to the organization of nonprint\\nmedia.\\n.X\\n90\\t1\\t231\\n231\\t6\\t231\\n261\\t1\\t231\\n295\\t1\\t231\\n299\\t1\\t231\\n334\\t1\\t231\\n352\\t2\\t231\\n354\\t1\\t231\\n383\\t1\\t231\\n608\\t1\\t231\\n610\\t1\\t231\\n617\\t1\\t231\\n620\\t1\\t231\\n815\\t1\\t231\\n911\\t1\\t231\\n938\\t1\\t231\\n939\\t1\\t231\\n991\\t1\\t231\\n992\\t2\\t231\\n1152\\t1\\t231\\n1153\\t1\\t231\\n1189\\t1\\t231\\n1221\\t1\\t231\\n1318\\t1\\t231\\n1365\\t1\\t231\\n1390\\t1\\t231\\n1390\\t1\\t231\\n.I 232\\n.T\\nBibliographic Control of Microforms\\n.A\\nReichmann, F.\\n.W\\n  Bibliographic control of microforms is a foremost need in today\\'s library\\nworld.

Its purpose was to train and inform\\nworking scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficient\\nmeans of seeking and acquiring work-related information.\\n  The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing\\nneed for working scientists and engineers to share and participate\\nin the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms,\\nand to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer\\napproaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination. \\nA further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate the\\nfullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer \\nin the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are\\nlikely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional\\nactivities.\\n.X\\n119\\t1\\t241\\n214\\t1\\t241\\n232\\t1\\t241\\n241\\t6\\t241\\n331\\t1\\t241\\n355\\t1\\t241\\n358\\t1\\t241\\n382\\t1\\t241\\n406\\t1\\t241\\n408\\t1\\t241\\n458\\t1\\t241\\n896\\t1\\t241\\n916\\t1\\t241\\n946\\t1\\t241\\n948\\t1\\t241\\n986\\t1\\t241\\n1012\\t1\\t241\\n1033\\t1\\t241\\n1079\\t1\\t241\\n1084\\t1\\t241\\n1249\\t1\\t241\\n1254\\t1\\t241\\n1379\\t1\\t241\\n1403\\t1\\t241\\n1403\\t1\\t241\\n.I 242\\n.T\\nBuilding Library Collections\\n.A\\nCarter, M.D.\\n.W\\n  Each year thousands of books are published by the\\ngeneral, the technical, the governmental and the university\\npresses in this and other countries.  From this overwhelming\\nmass of new publications every library must, within the limit\\nof its funds, select that small part which will be most \\nbeneficial to the community it serves.  This is properly an\\nawesome responsibility to the young inexperienced librarian.  To\\nthe competent veteran it is a task which though carried on\\nweek after week never can approach the ease of a well\\nmastered routine.  Each book examined requires the exercise\\nof careful judgement, integrity, emotional control at times,\\nand scrupulous honesty, guided always by a sense of purpose.\\n.X\\n11\\t1\\t242\\n242\\t5\\t242\\n1322\\t1\\t242\\n1322\\t1\\t242\\n.I 243\\n.T\\nCAN/DI system:  User reaction to a computer and information\\nretrieval system for Canadian scientists and technologists\\n.A\\nWolters, P.H.\\nBrown, J.E.\\n.W\\n  In April 1970, the CAN/SDI project, developed\\nby the Canadian National Science Library,\\ncompleted its first year of operation.

Descriptive\\ncase studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation\\nin which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully\\nutilized to solve the problem at hand.

Only\\nnow and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of\\nthe implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly \\ndescribed.\\n  It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and\\ndescription, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or\\nother similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such\\nworks, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of\\nwhat seem to be the most important aspects of each.\\n  Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States.\\nMany interesting practices have always been part of cataloging\\nabroad.

The CALBPC project was begun in 1965\\nby nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort\\nto establish a centralized acquisition and processing\\ncenter.  The report of Phase I-II, completed\\nin June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility\\nstudy, the design of the central system, costs\\nof acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a\\nnumber of related concerns such as accounting, the\\ncongruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward\\nlibrary services.\\n    This report focuses on the experimental operations\\nwhich were concluded officially on September 30,\\n1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the\\ntheory and principles upon which a system might\\nbe based, we are presently concerned with the\\npragmatics of book processing, the obstacles \\nencountered, and the solutions achieved.\\n    Although this report deals primarily with\\ncooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe\\nit also contributes to a better understanding of\\ncooperative programs.  The experiment was designed\\nto monitor operations throughout the acquisition/\\ncataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements\\nwere made on most internal and external aspects\\nof the system.  Monitoring also extended into\\nthe participating libraries where a product\\nacceptance study was conducted.  A secondary\\nobjective of the project was to observe the \\nrelationships which formed between the participants\\nand the central agency, such as the interface of\\nsystems and the human interaction of participants\\nand the Center.\\n.X\\n16\\t1\\t250\\n214\\t1\\t250\\n218\\t1\\t250\\n235\\t1\\t250\\n249\\t2\\t250\\n250\\t8\\t250\\n289\\t1\\t250\\n295\\t1\\t250\\n340\\t1\\t250\\n348\\t1\\t250\\n365\\t1\\t250\\n375\\t1\\t250\\n394\\t1\\t250\\n404\\t1\\t250\\n408\\t1\\t250\\n855\\t1\\t250\\n863\\t1\\t250\\n864\\t1\\t250\\n872\\t1\\t250\\n897\\t1\\t250\\n938\\t1\\t250\\n974\\t1\\t250\\n981\\t1\\t250\\n984\\t1\\t250\\n986\\t1\\t250\\n1012\\t1\\t250\\n1152\\t1\\t250\\n1188\\t1\\t250\\n1247\\t1\\t250\\n1257\\t1\\t250\\n1317\\t1\\t250\\n1379\\t1\\t250\\n1390\\t1\\t250\\n1392\\t1\\t250\\n1410\\t1\\t250\\n1410\\t1\\t250\\n.I 251\\n.T\\nCarl H.

The\\nresult of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority \\ncompleted correctly.

Law collections in\\nacademic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were\\nin a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one\\nof the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate\\nprovision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of\\nadopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored\\nto a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited\\nto overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There\\nseemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme\\ncapable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general\\nand special, academic and professional, in these countries. \\n.X\\n29\\t1\\t261\\n68\\t1\\t261\\n69\\t1\\t261\\n90\\t1\\t261\\n175\\t1\\t261\\n231\\t1\\t261\\n261\\t5\\t261\\n295\\t1\\t261\\n299\\t1\\t261\\n334\\t1\\t261\\n346\\t1\\t261\\n354\\t2\\t261\\n382\\t1\\t261\\n458\\t1\\t261\\n476\\t1\\t261\\n477\\t1\\t261\\n478\\t1\\t261\\n479\\t1\\t261\\n480\\t1\\t261\\n484\\t1\\t261\\n485\\t1\\t261\\n566\\t1\\t261\\n608\\t1\\t261\\n610\\t1\\t261\\n617\\t1\\t261\\n620\\t1\\t261\\n680\\t1\\t261\\n704\\t1\\t261\\n781\\t1\\t261\\n815\\t1\\t261\\n938\\t1\\t261\\n939\\t1\\t261\\n991\\t1\\t261\\n992\\t1\\t261\\n1118\\t1\\t261\\n1175\\t1\\t261\\n1221\\t1\\t261\\n1318\\t1\\t261\\n1365\\t1\\t261\\n1390\\t1\\t261\\n1390\\t1\\t261\\n.I 262\\n.T\\nClassification and Subject Index for a Library\\n.A\\nDewey, M.\\n.W\\n  The plan of the following Classification and Index was developed early in\\n1873.  It was the result of several months\\' study of library economy as found\\nin some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to\\nvarious American libraries.  In this study, the author became convinced that\\nthe usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional\\nexpenditure.  Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him\\nto believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the \\ncatalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to this\\nincreased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other method\\nwhich he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing and\\nindexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for\\nnumbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves.\\n.X\\n1\\t1\\t262\\n7\\t1\\t262\\n240\\t1\\t262\\n262\\t6\\t262\\n353\\t1\\t262\\n365\\t1\\t262\\n950\\t1\\t262\\n978\\t1\\t262\\n1028\\t1\\t262\\n1068\\t1\\t262\\n1203\\t1\\t262\\n1211\\t2\\t262\\n1212\\t2\\t262\\n1266\\t2\\t262\\n1424\\t1\\t262\\n1425\\t1\\t262\\n1425\\t1\\t262\\n.I 263\\n.T\\nClassification Catalogue Code\\n.A\\nRanganathan, S.R.\\n.W\\n  The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified catalogues\\nrepresent three successive stages in the order of evolution\\nof the internal form of the Library Catalogue.

While\\nthe number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly\\nlarge and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also\\nrespectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete\\ncodes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue.\\nHence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five\\nyears of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal\\ninfluence gained by its being taught to students of library\\nscience during the last twenty years.\\n  While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given\\nare constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of\\nthis Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for\\ntheir applicability.

In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive care\\nis regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silver\\nand brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are\\ngiven no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades\\nthe books more than it protects them.

To test this assumption the author\\nhypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out\\nof the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books \\nleft on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books \\ncharged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within \\nfinely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments..\\nIn the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters \\nand the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the\\nsecond, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library \\ncirculation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting\\nin-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out \\nto in, and the regression equation..\\n.X\\n46\\t2\\t290\\n266\\t1\\t290\\n277\\t1\\t290\\n280\\t1\\t290\\n282\\t2\\t290\\n284\\t1\\t290\\n290\\t8\\t290\\n925\\t2\\t290\\n943\\t1\\t290\\n981\\t1\\t290\\n1019\\t1\\t290\\n1023\\t1\\t290\\n1203\\t2\\t290\\n1416\\t1\\t290\\n1416\\t1\\t290\\n.I 291\\n.T\\nA Generalized Methodology for Library Systems Analysis\\n.A\\nBurns, R.W.\\n.W\\n  This article is directed toward the service in systems work.  Its purpose is \\nto generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can be\\nused in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a point\\nof view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-making\\nand resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticated\\ntechniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however,\\nwill be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to\\ndiscuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming,\\nsimulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of\\nthe other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations \\nresearch systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly\\nunderstood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal\\nof the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a\\ndelineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in \\nthis article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard \\ntechniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations \\nresearcher, and occasionally, even the librarian.\\n.X\\n120\\t1\\t291\\n128\\t1\\t291\\n135\\t1\\t291\\n178\\t1\\t291\\n235\\t1\\t291\\n244\\t1\\t291\\n245\\t2\\t291\\n249\\t1\\t291\\n288\\t1\\t291\\n289\\t1\\t291\\n291\\t6\\t291\\n292\\t1\\t291\\n408\\t1\\t291\\n459\\t1\\t291\\n548\\t1\\t291\\n575\\t1\\t291\\n591\\t1\\t291\\n594\\t1\\t291\\n597\\t1\\t291\\n598\\t1\\t291\\n599\\t1\\t291\\n601\\t1\\t291\\n621\\t1\\t291\\n630\\t1\\t291\\n692\\t1\\t291\\n836\\t1\\t291\\n863\\t1\\t291\\n864\\t1\\t291\\n865\\t2\\t291\\n866\\t1\\t291\\n868\\t1\\t291\\n897\\t1\\t291\\n915\\t1\\t291\\n916\\t1\\t291\\n925\\t3\\t291\\n936\\t1\\t291\\n945\\t1\\t291\\n957\\t1\\t291\\n959\\t1\\t291\\n960\\t2\\t291\\n961\\t2\\t291\\n962\\t1\\t291\\n972\\t1\\t291\\n982\\t1\\t291\\n984\\t1\\t291\\n1007\\t1\\t291\\n1052\\t1\\t291\\n1248\\t1\\t291\\n1317\\t1\\t291\\n1353\\t1\\t291\\n1358\\t1\\t291\\n1400\\t2\\t291\\n1401\\t2\\t291\\n1402\\t1\\t291\\n1402\\t1\\t291\\n.I 292\\n.T\\nCost Accounting and Analysis for University Libraries\\n.A\\nLeimkuhler, Ferdinand F.\\nCooper, Michael D.\\n.W\\n   The approach to library planning studies in this paper is the use of \\naccounting models to measure library costs and implement program budgets..

Five sources\\nare identified by the authors, including pressures from the president\\'s office,\\nlibrary stuff, faculty, and students.. These difficulties coupled with a \\ndeclining ability to meet user needs, the lack of cohesive library planning, \\nand an institutional inability to accommodate change have all contributed to the\\ndeclining status of the library director..

Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the\\nhistory of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing\\nwider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the\\nNew Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least\\ntemporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.\\n  This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some\\npart it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new\\nand their political activism consumes their necessarily limited\\nenergies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time\\nto produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is\\nscarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact\\nthat American radicals are often more American than they know and\\nmay prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the\\nintangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical\\nproblems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals\\nhave with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose more\\nexpressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture\\ndispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" of\\nintellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as\\nhas been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to\\nreason.\\n.X\\n89\\t1\\t308\\n105\\t1\\t308\\n107\\t1\\t308\\n308\\t5\\t308\\n1217\\t1\\t308\\n1331\\t1\\t308\\n1340\\t2\\t308\\n1348\\t1\\t308\\n1387\\t2\\t308\\n1387\\t2\\t308\\n.I 309\\n.T\\nThe SMART Automatic Document Retrieval System - An Illustration\\n.A\\nSalton, Gerard\\nLesk, M.E.\\n.W\\n   A fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the IBM 7094 is \\ndescribed..

Changes\\nin data representation will often be nedded as a result of changes in query, \\nupdate, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored \\ninformation.. \\n  Existing noninferential, formated data systems provide users with tree-\\nstructured files or slightly more general network models of the data.. In \\nSection 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed..

This situation is, of course, well known. \\n  Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance\\nimplies that the reward varies with different circumstances.\\nThat is, there may always be some customers who will not agree\\nthat the system\\'s output is satisfactory.  However, these\\nshould be relatively few.  In the case of an information\\nretrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to\\nfurnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.  \\nSo, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions\\nQ, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q)\\nwhich is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot be\\nchosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between\\nthe question and the resulting reference list.  Usually\\none says that the documents in the list are relevant to\\nthe question.  More precisely stated, we assume that the\\nenquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one\\nhe would have procured had he himself probed the documents\\nin the set.\\n.X\\n54\\t2\\t319\\n70\\t1\\t319\\n72\\t1\\t319\\n73\\t2\\t319\\n150\\t1\\t319\\n319\\t5\\t319\\n390\\t1\\t319\\n444\\t1\\t319\\n474\\t1\\t319\\n487\\t1\\t319\\n509\\t1\\t319\\n519\\t1\\t319\\n565\\t1\\t319\\n625\\t1\\t319\\n660\\t2\\t319\\n714\\t1\\t319\\n780\\t2\\t319\\n785\\t2\\t319\\n810\\t2\\t319\\n1279\\t1\\t319\\n1282\\t1\\t319\\n1307\\t1\\t319\\n1427\\t1\\t319\\n1427\\t1\\t319\\n.I 320\\n.T\\nThe Teachable Language Comprehender:\\nA Simulation Program and Theory of Language\\n.A\\nQuillian, M.R.\\n.W\\n  The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program\\ndesigned to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\"\\nEnglish text.  When text which the program has not seen before\\nis input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating\\neach (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large\\nmemory.  This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing\\nfactual assertions about the world.\\n  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory\\nwhich have been found to relate to the new text, adapting\\nand combining these copies to represent the meaning of the\\nnew text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program\\nsuccessfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as\\nthat of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the\\nmemory.\\n  Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities\\nfor correctly relating text to the memory\\'s prior content are to\\nbe taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently\\ncontains a relatively small number of examples of such\\nassertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for\\nexpressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program\\nnow corresponds to a general process for comprehending\\nlanguage, and it provides a methodology for adding the\\nadditional information this process requires to actually\\ncomprehend text of any particular kind.\\n  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC\\nallow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating\\ntext to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating\\ntext to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.\\nThat is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the\\nsystem, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many\\nother sentences in the future.\\n.X\\n61\\t1\\t320\\n77\\t1\\t320\\n79\\t1\\t320\\n117\\t1\\t320\\n168\\t2\\t320\\n175\\t1\\t320\\n274\\t1\\t320\\n317\\t2\\t320\\n320\\t6\\t320\\n458\\t1\\t320\\n459\\t1\\t320\\n488\\t1\\t320\\n489\\t1\\t320\\n493\\t1\\t320\\n498\\t1\\t320\\n499\\t1\\t320\\n526\\t1\\t320\\n546\\t1\\t320\\n558\\t1\\t320\\n570\\t1\\t320\\n572\\t1\\t320\\n579\\t1\\t320\\n581\\t1\\t320\\n590\\t1\\t320\\n606\\t1\\t320\\n626\\t1\\t320\\n659\\t1\\t320\\n664\\t1\\t320\\n754\\t1\\t320\\n790\\t1\\t320\\n814\\t1\\t320\\n826\\t1\\t320\\n1035\\t1\\t320\\n1046\\t2\\t320\\n1118\\t1\\t320\\n1294\\t1\\t320\\n1399\\t1\\t320\\n1427\\t1\\t320\\n1443\\t3\\t320\\n1443\\t3\\t320\\n.I 321\\n.T\\nAn Information-Theoretic Approach to Text Searching\\nin Direct Access Systems\\n.A\\nBarton, I.J.\\nCreasey, S.E.\\nLynch, M.F.\\nSnell, M.J.\\n.W\\n  Using direct access computer files of bibliographic\\ninformation, an attempt is made to overcome one of the\\nproblems often associated with information retrieval,\\nnamely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries,\\nthe greater part of which is used only infrequently.\\nA novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic\\nfrequency distribution of text characteristics onto a\\nrectangular distribution.

For there \\nis given here a wholly adequate description of the nature of the Corpus of\\nPresent-Day Edited American English on which this study is based, the details \\nof its constituents, and the modes of its transfer to tape.  A replica of that \\ntape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the \\ncost in time needed to produce a like corpus.  Accordingly, any reader who \\nseriously wants answers to further questions can set about getting those \\nanswers.\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t324\\n27\\t1\\t324\\n69\\t1\\t324\\n79\\t1\\t324\\n168\\t2\\t324\\n174\\t1\\t324\\n175\\t1\\t324\\n226\\t1\\t324\\n228\\t1\\t324\\n316\\t1\\t324\\n318\\t1\\t324\\n321\\t1\\t324\\n324\\t15\\t324\\n329\\t1\\t324\\n416\\t2\\t324\\n420\\t1\\t324\\n441\\t2\\t324\\n442\\t2\\t324\\n450\\t1\\t324\\n479\\t1\\t324\\n489\\t1\\t324\\n495\\t1\\t324\\n499\\t1\\t324\\n511\\t2\\t324\\n524\\t1\\t324\\n558\\t1\\t324\\n563\\t1\\t324\\n565\\t1\\t324\\n566\\t1\\t324\\n567\\t1\\t324\\n571\\t1\\t324\\n657\\t1\\t324\\n666\\t1\\t324\\n755\\t1\\t324\\n835\\t1\\t324\\n851\\t1\\t324\\n856\\t1\\t324\\n862\\t1\\t324\\n875\\t1\\t324\\n1084\\t1\\t324\\n1144\\t1\\t324\\n1194\\t1\\t324\\n1199\\t1\\t324\\n1265\\t1\\t324\\n1309\\t1\\t324\\n1394\\t1\\t324\\n1395\\t1\\t324\\n1419\\t1\\t324\\n1419\\t1\\t324\\n.I 325\\n.T\\nComputer-Based Library and Information Systems\\n.A\\nHenley, J.P.\\n.W\\n  This book describes some of the various ways in which a computer\\ncould be used as part of a library system.  In doing so, it aims to bridge\\nthe gap between librarian and computer specialist, by introducing\\ncomputers to those involved in library work, especially students of\\nlibrarianship, and at the same time helping to make those interested\\nin the computer applications field aware of the potential and problems\\nof the library environment.\\n.X\\n325\\t5\\t325\\n482\\t1\\t325\\n837\\t1\\t325\\n837\\t1\\t325\\n.I 326\\n.T\\nComputer Filing of Index Bibliographic and Catalog Entries\\n.A\\nHines, T.C.\\n.W\\n  The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement\\nhas become increasingly apparent as more and more book\\ncatalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Many\\nof the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rules\\nfor Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to cope\\nwith when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not an\\nobject, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are\\npractically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedures\\ncan make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog,\\nor bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, and\\nthese modifications are made in this proposed code for computer\\nfiling of complex alphabetic entries.\\n.X\\n39\\t1\\t326\\n50\\t1\\t326\\n92\\t1\\t326\\n209\\t1\\t326\\n235\\t1\\t326\\n246\\t1\\t326\\n247\\t1\\t326\\n276\\t1\\t326\\n326\\t7\\t326\\n333\\t1\\t326\\n446\\t1\\t326\\n473\\t1\\t326\\n485\\t1\\t326\\n503\\t1\\t326\\n572\\t1\\t326\\n616\\t1\\t326\\n632\\t1\\t326\\n746\\t1\\t326\\n773\\t1\\t326\\n848\\t1\\t326\\n874\\t1\\t326\\n880\\t1\\t326\\n922\\t1\\t326\\n928\\t1\\t326\\n950\\t1\\t326\\n958\\t1\\t326\\n963\\t1\\t326\\n973\\t1\\t326\\n991\\t1\\t326\\n997\\t1\\t326\\n1000\\t1\\t326\\n1153\\t1\\t326\\n1207\\t1\\t326\\n1216\\t1\\t326\\n1266\\t1\\t326\\n1283\\t1\\t326\\n1395\\t1\\t326\\n1426\\t1\\t326\\n1441\\t1\\t326\\n1441\\t1\\t326\\n.I 327\\n.T\\nComputer Handling of Chemical Structure Information\\n.A\\nLynch, M.F.\\n.W\\n  Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science\\nare at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental\\neffects on scientists\\'s use of and access to existing knowledge.\\nThese changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer\\ntechniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific\\nand technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes\\nare not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a\\nlabour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring\\nman-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and\\nincreasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access.\\nBut the changes to be effected also have major social implications;\\nthe reasons for publication and use of information are complex,\\nreflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still \\nimperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information-\\nhandling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their\\nappreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer,\\nbut also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators\\nof information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their\\nperception of the usefulness of the newer methods.\\n.X\\n116\\t1\\t327\\n117\\t1\\t327\\n175\\t1\\t327\\n176\\t1\\t327\\n254\\t3\\t327\\n327\\t11\\t327\\n389\\t1\\t327\\n509\\t1\\t327\\n568\\t3\\t327\\n569\\t2\\t327\\n619\\t1\\t327\\n641\\t1\\t327\\n668\\t1\\t327\\n670\\t1\\t327\\n671\\t3\\t327\\n673\\t1\\t327\\n677\\t1\\t327\\n678\\t1\\t327\\n679\\t1\\t327\\n682\\t1\\t327\\n689\\t1\\t327\\n690\\t1\\t327\\n692\\t1\\t327\\n693\\t1\\t327\\n694\\t1\\t327\\n695\\t2\\t327\\n698\\t2\\t327\\n700\\t1\\t327\\n704\\t1\\t327\\n706\\t3\\t327\\n707\\t1\\t327\\n730\\t1\\t327\\n738\\t1\\t327\\n817\\t1\\t327\\n833\\t1\\t327\\n890\\t3\\t327\\n1026\\t1\\t327\\n1044\\t1\\t327\\n1072\\t1\\t327\\n1092\\t3\\t327\\n1218\\t1\\t327\\n1292\\t2\\t327\\n1452\\t2\\t327\\n1452\\t2\\t327\\n.I 328\\n.T\\nCurrent approaches to classification and clump-finding at the Cambridge\\nLanguage Research Unit\\n.A\\nSparck-Jones, K.\\nJackson, David\\n.W\\n   Computer programs for automatic classification are a desideratum in many \\nfields..

Inverted-file retrieval systems using free\\ntext data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which \\nthe file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore \\ninvolve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization\\nof storage because of the distribution characteristics..\\n   An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of\\nsets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of\\nwhich are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to \\nsubstantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in \\ndictionary look-up times and storage utilization.\\n.X\\n19\\t2\\t329\\n44\\t1\\t329\\n57\\t2\\t329\\n75\\t1\\t329\\n176\\t1\\t329\\n228\\t3\\t329\\n229\\t1\\t329\\n318\\t2\\t329\\n321\\t2\\t329\\n324\\t1\\t329\\n329\\t11\\t329\\n346\\t1\\t329\\n359\\t1\\t329\\n416\\t4\\t329\\n442\\t5\\t329\\n450\\t4\\t329\\n495\\t3\\t329\\n511\\t6\\t329\\n521\\t2\\t329\\n524\\t2\\t329\\n536\\t1\\t329\\n563\\t1\\t329\\n565\\t4\\t329\\n567\\t3\\t329\\n572\\t1\\t329\\n595\\t1\\t329\\n596\\t1\\t329\\n608\\t1\\t329\\n619\\t1\\t329\\n700\\t2\\t329\\n791\\t3\\t329\\n810\\t1\\t329\\n812\\t1\\t329\\n813\\t1\\t329\\n814\\t1\\t329\\n835\\t1\\t329\\n851\\t1\\t329\\n862\\t1\\t329\\n867\\t1\\t329\\n870\\t1\\t329\\n872\\t1\\t329\\n875\\t3\\t329\\n894\\t2\\t329\\n928\\t1\\t329\\n963\\t1\\t329\\n990\\t1\\t329\\n991\\t1\\t329\\n1194\\t2\\t329\\n1196\\t1\\t329\\n1199\\t3\\t329\\n1255\\t1\\t329\\n1362\\t1\\t329\\n1396\\t1\\t329\\n1398\\t1\\t329\\n1413\\t1\\t329\\n1445\\t1\\t329\\n1445\\t1\\t329\\n.I 330\\n.T\\nComputer Readable Bibliographic Data Bases -- A Directory and Data Sourcebook\\n.A\\nWilliams, M.E.\\n.W\\n  This document, Computer Readable Bibliographic Data Bases -- A Directory\\nand Data Sourcebook not only updates the 1973 publication, which included \\ninformation on 81 data bases, but expands the coverage to 300 data bases and \\nincludes considerably more information about the data bases.\\n  Methodology used to obtain data involved:  (1) consulting published and\\nunpublished sources; (2) design of a 13 page questionnaire; (3) mail survey;\\nand (4) telephone follow up and verification.

For\\ntwo thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major\\nphilosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical\\npreoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques \\nof classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally\\nignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical\\nmodels of classification and highly developed classifications of various\\nbranches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general\\nclassification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical\\nproblems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is\\nimportant from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because\\nthe general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of\\nknowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists\\nin classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.\\n.X\\n335\\t6\\t335\\n342\\t1\\t335\\n434\\t1\\t335\\n643\\t1\\t335\\n644\\t1\\t335\\n645\\t1\\t335\\n885\\t1\\t335\\n947\\t1\\t335\\n1437\\t1\\t335\\n1437\\t1\\t335\\n.I 336\\n.T\\nConceptual Design of an Automated National Library System\\n.A\\nMeise, N.R.\\n.W\\n    This work describes a conceptual design of an automated\\nnational library system.

The contribution of these library\\npersonnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective\\nhave led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However,\\nas would be expected when such a large number of people are involved,\\nthere were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of\\nopinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from\\nthe various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences\\nrelated to the input into and control over the policies of the national\\nstructure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined\\nin Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended\\nmodel are presented at the end of Chapter 4.

Local public libraries, systems of public libraries,\\nand state library agencies are included in this category.\\n  School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of\\nschools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School libraries\\nat the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are\\nincluded.\\n  Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of\\nhigher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which,\\nwhile they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known\\nfor their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries,\\nuniversity libraries, and technical school libraries are included as\\nacademic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and \\nLinda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.\\n  Special libraries are those directed toward making information available\\nto people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined\\ninformation needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of\\nnonprofit organizations are common examples.\\n  While distinctions between research and special libraries are not\\nalways easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no\\nserious problems are created.\\n.X\\n214\\t1\\t340\\n218\\t1\\t340\\n250\\t1\\t340\\n340\\t8\\t340\\n348\\t1\\t340\\n375\\t1\\t340\\n431\\t3\\t340\\n855\\t1\\t340\\n910\\t1\\t340\\n937\\t1\\t340\\n939\\t2\\t340\\n955\\t1\\t340\\n986\\t1\\t340\\n1009\\t1\\t340\\n1012\\t1\\t340\\n1188\\t1\\t340\\n1236\\t1\\t340\\n1247\\t1\\t340\\n1354\\t1\\t340\\n1379\\t1\\t340\\n1390\\t1\\t340\\n1424\\t1\\t340\\n1424\\t1\\t340\\n.I 341\\n.T\\nCopying Methods Manual\\n.A\\nHawken, N.R.\\n.W\\n  The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, \\nmethods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing \\ndocuments of a great many different kinds arises from two factors:\\n  (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the \\nacquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information\\nvital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an \\ninternational scale.\\n  (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has \\nresulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.\\n  The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate\\ngraft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the \\ngreat changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were \\ndiscrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes\\nand combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities\\ncontinue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been \\npowerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for \\na share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.  The results, \\nhowever, have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of \\nresearch materials as well.\\n.X\\n56\\t1\\t341\\n341\\t5\\t341\\n1269\\t1\\t341\\n1371\\t1\\t341\\n1371\\t1\\t341\\n.I 342\\n.T\\nCorporate Headings:  Their use in library cataloguing and\\nnational bibliographics:  A comparative and critical study \\n.A\\nVerona, E.\\n.W\\n  This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the\\nmain problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties\\nraised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various\\ncountries.\\n  In order to make the differences existing between the various\\nsolutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of\\nthem more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of\\nlanguages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, \\nprinted lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples\\nare also intended to draw attention to differences existing with\\nregard to various technical details, such as punctuation, \\ncapitalization, transliteration, etc.\\n  In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that\\ncertain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one\\ncountry or one language would not satisfy the requirements of\\nanother country or another language.\\n  In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been \\ncomplemented by references to professional literature on the subject\\navailable to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed\\nthere.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing\\npractices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users\\'\\napproach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated\\nthat, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for\\ncorporate headings present more problems than any other type of\\nheading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as\\nyet paid insufficient attention to these problems. \\n.X\\n333\\t1\\t342\\n335\\t1\\t342\\n342\\t15\\t342\\n434\\t1\\t342\\n643\\t1\\t342\\n644\\t1\\t342\\n645\\t1\\t342\\n885\\t1\\t342\\n888\\t1\\t342\\n920\\t1\\t342\\n947\\t1\\t342\\n1001\\t1\\t342\\n1004\\t1\\t342\\n1324\\t1\\t342\\n1437\\t1\\t342\\n1437\\t1\\t342\\n.I 343\\n.T\\nA Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge\\n.A\\nKuhn, T.J.\\n.W\\n  On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems,\\nSir Karl\\'s view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  We\\nare both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge\\nis acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of\\nscientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate  \\ndata the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us\\nturn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw\\nmany of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science\\nprogresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by\\nwhich an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one;\\nand both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older\\ntheory\\'s occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment,\\nor observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number\\nof classical positivism\\'s most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for\\nexample, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation\\nwith scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to\\nproduce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists\\nmay properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and\\nthat do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.\\n.X\\n100\\t1\\t343\\n101\\t2\\t343\\n102\\t1\\t343\\n343\\t13\\t343\\n391\\t1\\t343\\n417\\t1\\t343\\n438\\t1\\t343\\n514\\t1\\t343\\n546\\t1\\t343\\n606\\t1\\t343\\n610\\t1\\t343\\n611\\t1\\t343\\n612\\t1\\t343\\n626\\t1\\t343\\n1063\\t1\\t343\\n1187\\t1\\t343\\n1271\\t3\\t343\\n1272\\t2\\t343\\n1289\\t1\\t343\\n1296\\t1\\t343\\n1310\\t2\\t343\\n1311\\t2\\t343\\n1314\\t1\\t343\\n1339\\t1\\t343\\n1340\\t1\\t343\\n1345\\t1\\t343\\n1386\\t4\\t343\\n1387\\t2\\t343\\n1387\\t2\\t343\\n.I 344\\n.T\\nCurrent Problems in Reference Service\\n.A\\nGalvin, T.J.\\n.W\\n  Current Problems in Reference Service is a collection of thirty-five new\\nproblem case studies intended for instructional use in both formal and \\ninformal teaching-learning situations in the field of librarianship.\\n.X\\n344\\t5\\t344\\n344\\t5\\t344\\n.I 345\\n.T\\nData Bases; Computers, and the Social Sciences\\n.A\\nBisco, R.L.\\n.W\\n  This book was written with several diverse audiences in mind: (1)\\nsocial and behavioral scientists and their students, (2) librarians and\\nlibrary-science students who are favorable about employing computers\\nand computer-usable information in their work and classes, and (3)\\narchivists and their employees who desire to have more than a current\\noverview of the problems and their tentative solutions.

The center does not conceive of its task as being\\nmerely the mechanization of library procedures of the past.\\n  For the immediate future, the principal academic objective\\nof the center is to increase the availability of library\\nresources for use in educational and research programs in\\ncolleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant\\nobjective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the\\nprograms of instruction and research in their institutions.\\nThe passive service functions that libraries have developed\\nduring the past century are proving inadequate to meet the\\npresent demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly\\ninadequate in the future.\\n  The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat\\nmore than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general\\neconomy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the\\nOhio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise\\nof per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will\\napproximate that of the economy as a whole.\\n.X\\n63\\t1\\t348\\n90\\t1\\t348\\n159\\t1\\t348\\n175\\t1\\t348\\n177\\t1\\t348\\n214\\t1\\t348\\n218\\t1\\t348\\n250\\t1\\t348\\n287\\t2\\t348\\n340\\t1\\t348\\n348\\t11\\t348\\n375\\t1\\t348\\n389\\t1\\t348\\n390\\t1\\t348\\n406\\t1\\t348\\n408\\t2\\t348\\n487\\t1\\t348\\n502\\t1\\t348\\n546\\t1\\t348\\n554\\t1\\t348\\n579\\t1\\t348\\n582\\t1\\t348\\n583\\t1\\t348\\n584\\t1\\t348\\n585\\t1\\t348\\n596\\t1\\t348\\n600\\t1\\t348\\n601\\t1\\t348\\n654\\t1\\t348\\n655\\t1\\t348\\n797\\t1\\t348\\n798\\t1\\t348\\n799\\t2\\t348\\n805\\t1\\t348\\n807\\t1\\t348\\n834\\t1\\t348\\n849\\t1\\t348\\n851\\t1\\t348\\n855\\t1\\t348\\n856\\t1\\t348\\n857\\t1\\t348\\n858\\t2\\t348\\n859\\t3\\t348\\n860\\t1\\t348\\n861\\t2\\t348\\n862\\t1\\t348\\n863\\t1\\t348\\n864\\t1\\t348\\n868\\t1\\t348\\n872\\t1\\t348\\n897\\t1\\t348\\n916\\t1\\t348\\n954\\t1\\t348\\n956\\t1\\t348\\n963\\t1\\t348\\n979\\t1\\t348\\n986\\t1\\t348\\n987\\t1\\t348\\n988\\t1\\t348\\n989\\t1\\t348\\n1007\\t1\\t348\\n1012\\t2\\t348\\n1013\\t1\\t348\\n1035\\t1\\t348\\n1152\\t1\\t348\\n1188\\t1\\t348\\n1196\\t1\\t348\\n1197\\t1\\t348\\n1265\\t1\\t348\\n1294\\t1\\t348\\n1327\\t1\\t348\\n1333\\t1\\t348\\n1362\\t1\\t348\\n1363\\t1\\t348\\n1366\\t1\\t348\\n1379\\t1\\t348\\n1445\\t1\\t348\\n1445\\t1\\t348\\n.I 349\\n.T\\nDecision Analysis:  Introductory Lectures on Choices Under Uncertainty\\n.A\\nRaiffa, H.\\n.W\\n  These lectures do not present a descriptive theory of actual behavior.\\nNeither do they present a positive theory of behavior for a superintelligent,\\nfictitious being; nowhere in our analysis shall we refer to the behavior of an\\n\"idealized, rational, and economic man,\" a man who always acts in a perfectly\\nconsistent manner as if somehow there were embedded in his nature a coherent\\nset of evaluation patterns that cover any and all eventualities.

The danger of\\ndestruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world\\nof knowledge and scholarship that they support.

Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply\\nof source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service \\nstudies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries,\\nno one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American\\nlibrarianship.

Today, statistical\\nmethods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for\\ndoctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for\\none foreign language.

Thus a basis for\\ncomparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides\\na foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs\\nof service to the disadvantaged might move.\\n  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices\\nin low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.\\nIn each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and\\nobservation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of\\nthe community residents, (2) library services in relation to other\\navailable community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the\\nneighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the\\nlibrary system, and (4) available measures of the impact or\\neffectiveness of the program.\\n.X\\n9\\t1\\t358\\n10\\t1\\t358\\n161\\t1\\t358\\n190\\t1\\t358\\n207\\t1\\t358\\n208\\t1\\t358\\n222\\t1\\t358\\n223\\t1\\t358\\n225\\t1\\t358\\n232\\t1\\t358\\n239\\t2\\t358\\n241\\t1\\t358\\n244\\t1\\t358\\n295\\t1\\t358\\n296\\t1\\t358\\n297\\t1\\t358\\n298\\t1\\t358\\n300\\t2\\t358\\n301\\t1\\t358\\n302\\t1\\t358\\n304\\t1\\t358\\n305\\t1\\t358\\n306\\t1\\t358\\n331\\t1\\t358\\n358\\t16\\t358\\n364\\t1\\t358\\n385\\t2\\t358\\n394\\t1\\t358\\n406\\t1\\t358\\n433\\t2\\t358\\n459\\t1\\t358\\n515\\t1\\t358\\n534\\t1\\t358\\n535\\t1\\t358\\n624\\t1\\t358\\n625\\t1\\t358\\n629\\t1\\t358\\n631\\t2\\t358\\n634\\t1\\t358\\n702\\t1\\t358\\n731\\t1\\t358\\n732\\t1\\t358\\n791\\t1\\t358\\n811\\t1\\t358\\n816\\t1\\t358\\n817\\t1\\t358\\n818\\t1\\t358\\n820\\t1\\t358\\n823\\t2\\t358\\n825\\t1\\t358\\n826\\t1\\t358\\n827\\t1\\t358\\n828\\t1\\t358\\n843\\t1\\t358\\n844\\t1\\t358\\n846\\t1\\t358\\n896\\t1\\t358\\n908\\t1\\t358\\n915\\t1\\t358\\n937\\t2\\t358\\n946\\t5\\t358\\n947\\t1\\t358\\n948\\t2\\t358\\n961\\t1\\t358\\n962\\t1\\t358\\n964\\t1\\t358\\n994\\t1\\t358\\n1005\\t4\\t358\\n1015\\t1\\t358\\n1017\\t1\\t358\\n1018\\t2\\t358\\n1032\\t1\\t358\\n1033\\t1\\t358\\n1056\\t4\\t358\\n1058\\t1\\t358\\n1079\\t1\\t358\\n1145\\t2\\t358\\n1146\\t1\\t358\\n1227\\t1\\t358\\n1230\\t1\\t358\\n1240\\t2\\t358\\n1242\\t1\\t358\\n1247\\t1\\t358\\n1257\\t1\\t358\\n1268\\t1\\t358\\n1354\\t1\\t358\\n1373\\t1\\t358\\n1379\\t1\\t358\\n1384\\t1\\t358\\n1390\\t1\\t358\\n1403\\t1\\t358\\n1403\\t1\\t358\\n.I 359\\n.T\\nDocumentation\\n.A\\nBradford, S.C.\\n.B\\n1948\\n.W\\n  More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started\\ntheir lives\\' work, which at first was connected with the term\\n\"bibliography,\" but to which gradually the work \"Documentation\"\\nwas attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scope\\nthan the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed\\nand non-printed documents.\\n  The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked\\nside by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of\\nwhat is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a\\ncommon treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension\\nand to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill\\nof all nations.\\n  It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men,\\nwhose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to\\nsee the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.\\n  And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge\\nand experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only\\ngave his strong and valuable support to the common work but\\nadded to it fundamental and constructive new elements.\\n  Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far\\nmore than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such\\na compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously\\nenough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on\\ndocumentation available.

How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds of\\nbooks should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Why\\ndo some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various\\nservices provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take\\nto improve its services?  What are the library\\'s options in choosing among the\\ndifferent circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to\\nbe checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?

In the course\\nof our study, we have examined the data for comprehensiveness\\nand consistency; we have investigated their intertemporal\\nbehavior, both as a basis for projection and as an\\ninstrument for long-range planning; and we have constructed\\na set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive\\nstatistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most\\ncritical economic variables relating to library operations.

To take but one \\nfield, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers\\nto be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million\\nto be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one\\nmillion papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and\\nbefore 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal\\nto the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be\\npublished and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began\\npublication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum\\nLibrary was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a\\nfurther 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology\\n(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use\\nof scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930\\nthe number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the\\nN.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science\\nMuseum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of\\nall the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period\\nwhich itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for\\npeaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic\\nmaterials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).\\nThere are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples\\nmay not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at\\na very high level indeed.\\n.X\\n2\\t1\\t371\\n22\\t1\\t371\\n60\\t1\\t371\\n150\\t1\\t371\\n243\\t1\\t371\\n272\\t1\\t371\\n339\\t1\\t371\\n347\\t1\\t371\\n371\\t13\\t371\\n382\\t1\\t371\\n387\\t1\\t371\\n465\\t1\\t371\\n466\\t1\\t371\\n475\\t1\\t371\\n480\\t2\\t371\\n658\\t1\\t371\\n681\\t1\\t371\\n682\\t1\\t371\\n704\\t1\\t371\\n716\\t1\\t371\\n717\\t1\\t371\\n760\\t1\\t371\\n770\\t1\\t371\\n776\\t1\\t371\\n839\\t1\\t371\\n844\\t1\\t371\\n923\\t1\\t371\\n924\\t1\\t371\\n967\\t1\\t371\\n1403\\t1\\t371\\n1404\\t1\\t371\\n1404\\t1\\t371\\n.I 372\\n.T\\nEfficiency of the Scientific Information\\n.A\\nKozenko, A.V.\\n.W\\nThis book considers basic tendency of the development of information science,\\ntheoretically proves necessity and feasibility (possibility) of determining\\nthe economical effectiveness of scientific-technical information.\\n.X\\n372\\t9\\t372\\n1096\\t1\\t372\\n1100\\t3\\t372\\n1156\\t1\\t372\\n1161\\t1\\t372\\n1191\\t2\\t372\\n1191\\t2\\t372\\n.I 373\\n.T\\nSome User Requirements Stated Quantitatively \\nin Terms of the 90 Percent Library\\n.A\\nBourne, C.P.\\n.W\\n  Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very\\nlittle verified information and few guidelines to describe the user\\'s specific\\nrequirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly\\ndesign or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements\\nof requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion\\nrather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been\\nobtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are\\nextremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and\\nstate user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an\\napproach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a\\nmethod of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more\\nconvenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several\\nexamples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that\\nsupport these statements.\\n  In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements\\nof workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious\\nattempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite\\nlikely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be\\nextended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.\\n.X\\n31\\t1\\t373\\n33\\t2\\t373\\n36\\t1\\t373\\n41\\t1\\t373\\n89\\t1\\t373\\n97\\t1\\t373\\n102\\t1\\t373\\n111\\t1\\t373\\n112\\t1\\t373\\n163\\t1\\t373\\n183\\t1\\t373\\n184\\t1\\t373\\n193\\t1\\t373\\n199\\t1\\t373\\n201\\t3\\t373\\n203\\t3\\t373\\n210\\t1\\t373\\n225\\t1\\t373\\n269\\t1\\t373\\n359\\t1\\t373\\n373\\t6\\t373\\n379\\t1\\t373\\n475\\t1\\t373\\n545\\t1\\t373\\n552\\t1\\t373\\n587\\t1\\t373\\n605\\t1\\t373\\n613\\t1\\t373\\n614\\t1\\t373\\n638\\t1\\t373\\n735\\t1\\t373\\n747\\t1\\t373\\n748\\t1\\t373\\n750\\t1\\t373\\n753\\t1\\t373\\n766\\t1\\t373\\n767\\t1\\t373\\n775\\t2\\t373\\n782\\t1\\t373\\n784\\t1\\t373\\n788\\t1\\t373\\n789\\t1\\t373\\n793\\t1\\t373\\n800\\t1\\t373\\n808\\t1\\t373\\n889\\t1\\t373\\n905\\t1\\t373\\n953\\t1\\t373\\n977\\t3\\t373\\n983\\t1\\t373\\n1016\\t1\\t373\\n1019\\t1\\t373\\n1023\\t1\\t373\\n1030\\t1\\t373\\n1055\\t1\\t373\\n1087\\t1\\t373\\n1090\\t1\\t373\\n1135\\t1\\t373\\n1173\\t1\\t373\\n1203\\t2\\t373\\n1256\\t1\\t373\\n1260\\t1\\t373\\n1275\\t1\\t373\\n1276\\t1\\t373\\n1278\\t1\\t373\\n1280\\t1\\t373\\n1285\\t1\\t373\\n1286\\t1\\t373\\n1287\\t1\\t373\\n1302\\t1\\t373\\n1335\\t1\\t373\\n1352\\t1\\t373\\n1390\\t1\\t373\\n1397\\t2\\t373\\n1417\\t1\\t373\\n1428\\t1\\t373\\n1432\\t1\\t373\\n1432\\t1\\t373\\n.I 374\\n.T\\nElectronic Data Processing in the University Library\\n.A\\nPflug, G.\\n.W\\n    Following five years of experience with the mechanization\\nof procedures using data processing equipment, the university\\nlibrary in Bochum is attempting to summarize its findings.\\nA comparison with earlier publications about the use of\\nelectronic data processing equipment shows in what measure\\nthe original plans have actually been affected by the\\nexperience that has been gained.

The primary advantage of citation indexing\\nis that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked\\nin a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation \\nof citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing\\nmethods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore,\\ncitations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not \\nvulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used\\nin subject indexes.\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t377\\n37\\t1\\t377\\n39\\t1\\t377\\n40\\t1\\t377\\n41\\t1\\t377\\n47\\t2\\t377\\n88\\t1\\t377\\n97\\t1\\t377\\n102\\t1\\t377\\n103\\t1\\t377\\n106\\t1\\t377\\n233\\t1\\t377\\n253\\t1\\t377\\n313\\t1\\t377\\n359\\t1\\t377\\n377\\t7\\t377\\n379\\t1\\t377\\n395\\t1\\t377\\n505\\t1\\t377\\n560\\t1\\t377\\n573\\t1\\t377\\n605\\t1\\t377\\n613\\t1\\t377\\n618\\t1\\t377\\n632\\t3\\t377\\n635\\t1\\t377\\n667\\t1\\t377\\n748\\t1\\t377\\n749\\t1\\t377\\n751\\t1\\t377\\n764\\t2\\t377\\n765\\t1\\t377\\n777\\t1\\t377\\n778\\t1\\t377\\n782\\t1\\t377\\n804\\t1\\t377\\n805\\t1\\t377\\n893\\t1\\t377\\n952\\t1\\t377\\n1016\\t1\\t377\\n1061\\t1\\t377\\n1085\\t1\\t377\\n1086\\t1\\t377\\n1087\\t2\\t377\\n1182\\t1\\t377\\n1200\\t1\\t377\\n1234\\t1\\t377\\n1274\\t3\\t377\\n1277\\t3\\t377\\n1278\\t2\\t377\\n1280\\t2\\t377\\n1285\\t2\\t377\\n1287\\t1\\t377\\n1301\\t2\\t377\\n1302\\t3\\t377\\n1304\\t1\\t377\\n1313\\t3\\t377\\n1338\\t1\\t377\\n1344\\t1\\t377\\n1347\\t1\\t377\\n1380\\t1\\t377\\n1428\\t1\\t377\\n1444\\t2\\t377\\n1444\\t2\\t377\\n.I 378\\n.T\\nDialog Interactive Information Retrieval System\\n.A\\nSummet, R.K.\\n.W\\n  DIALOG is the name given to an interactive, computer-based information\\nretrieval language developed at the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.  \\nThe DIALOG systems consists of a series of computer programs which have been\\ndesigned to make full use of direct access memory devices (in which data \\nlocated anywhere on the device can be accessed in approximately the same amount\\nof time) and video display units to provide the user a rapid and powerful means\\nof identifying records within a file which satisfy the particular information\\nneed.

On this hypothesis, the aggregate of\\nperiodicals can be divided into classes according to\\nrelevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the\\nmore remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce\\nas many references as the more related classes.  The\\nwhole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of\\nsuccessive generations of diminishing kinship, each\\ngeneration being greater in number than the\\npreceding, and each constituent of a generation \\nproducing inversely according to its degree of\\nremoteness. \\n  The investigation covered, in the first place, the\\nreferences quoted, in the course of four and two and\\na-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies\\nof Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are \\nprepared in the library.

This has stimulated the development of digital\\ncomputers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic\\nincrease in the volume of data communicated between such\\nmachines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some\\ncases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either\\nerror-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in\\nthe terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more \\neconomical.\\n.X\\n380\\t5\\t380\\n380\\t5\\t380\\n.I 381\\n.T\\nThe Evaluation of Information Services and Products\\n.A\\nKing, D.W.\\n.W\\n  The continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research of\\nothers, coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of published\\nmaterial during the past several decades, has placed new emphasis on\\nthe old arts of assembling, coding, and disseminating recorded\\nknowledge.  In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself in\\nresearch on improvement of traditional library systems.  In other\\ninstances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and\\ntheir intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still other\\nsystems have progressed from the passive role of responding to\\nrequests to the active role of supplying documents, or references to\\nthem, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of a\\nmore descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to in\\nthis book as \"document transfer systems,\" implying that the product\\nbeing retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than the\\ninformation (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrieval\\nsystems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern.\\nThe document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing,\\nan abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape.\\n.X\\n28\\t1\\t381\\n73\\t1\\t381\\n74\\t1\\t381\\n83\\t1\\t381\\n124\\t1\\t381\\n125\\t1\\t381\\n157\\t1\\t381\\n165\\t1\\t381\\n175\\t1\\t381\\n213\\t1\\t381\\n224\\t1\\t381\\n245\\t1\\t381\\n273\\t1\\t381\\n279\\t1\\t381\\n288\\t1\\t381\\n298\\t1\\t381\\n331\\t1\\t381\\n381\\t17\\t381\\n382\\t2\\t381\\n389\\t1\\t381\\n408\\t1\\t381\\n445\\t1\\t381\\n448\\t1\\t381\\n452\\t1\\t381\\n456\\t1\\t381\\n458\\t1\\t381\\n468\\t1\\t381\\n484\\t1\\t381\\n490\\t2\\t381\\n491\\t1\\t381\\n496\\t1\\t381\\n506\\t1\\t381\\n511\\t1\\t381\\n514\\t2\\t381\\n516\\t1\\t381\\n518\\t2\\t381\\n521\\t1\\t381\\n522\\t1\\t381\\n523\\t1\\t381\\n526\\t1\\t381\\n527\\t1\\t381\\n528\\t1\\t381\\n529\\t1\\t381\\n554\\t1\\t381\\n575\\t2\\t381\\n579\\t1\\t381\\n591\\t4\\t381\\n592\\t1\\t381\\n595\\t2\\t381\\n599\\t1\\t381\\n603\\t1\\t381\\n610\\t1\\t381\\n615\\t3\\t381\\n619\\t1\\t381\\n620\\t1\\t381\\n621\\t1\\t381\\n625\\t2\\t381\\n626\\t1\\t381\\n630\\t1\\t381\\n636\\t1\\t381\\n639\\t1\\t381\\n646\\t1\\t381\\n676\\t1\\t381\\n696\\t1\\t381\\n700\\t1\\t381\\n705\\t1\\t381\\n707\\t1\\t381\\n723\\t2\\t381\\n724\\t1\\t381\\n727\\t1\\t381\\n752\\t2\\t381\\n754\\t1\\t381\\n779\\t1\\t381\\n780\\t1\\t381\\n785\\t2\\t381\\n812\\t1\\t381\\n817\\t1\\t381\\n820\\t1\\t381\\n822\\t4\\t381\\n824\\t1\\t381\\n827\\t1\\t381\\n829\\t1\\t381\\n834\\t1\\t381\\n860\\t1\\t381\\n875\\t1\\t381\\n895\\t1\\t381\\n907\\t1\\t381\\n925\\t1\\t381\\n957\\t1\\t381\\n976\\t1\\t381\\n986\\t1\\t381\\n1065\\t1\\t381\\n1078\\t1\\t381\\n1091\\t1\\t381\\n1148\\t1\\t381\\n1227\\t1\\t381\\n1279\\t1\\t381\\n1282\\t2\\t381\\n1303\\t1\\t381\\n1317\\t1\\t381\\n1327\\t1\\t381\\n1353\\t1\\t381\\n1359\\t1\\t381\\n1360\\t1\\t381\\n1364\\t1\\t381\\n1366\\t1\\t381\\n1367\\t1\\t381\\n1368\\t1\\t381\\n1400\\t1\\t381\\n1410\\t1\\t381\\n1424\\t1\\t381\\n1448\\t1\\t381\\n1448\\t1\\t381\\n.I 382\\n.T\\nEvaluation of MEDLARS Documentation\\n.A\\nLancaster, f.W.\\n.W\\n  This report presents the results of a detailed analysis by\\nthe National Library of Medicine of the performance of\\nMEDLARS (its Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval\\nSystem) in relation to 300 actual requests made to the\\nsystem in 1966 and 1967.

For documentation and information retrieval in\\ngeneral, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and\\nmachine selection are also available.  That classification is of\\nvalue in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,\\nhowever, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency\\nand subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection\\ndesigners of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce\\nclassificatory techniques.

Government expenditures\\nfor research and development have increased from a modest\\nannual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.\\nThe research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were\\nalmost miniscule in the 1930\\'s, total approximately $8 billion today.\\nThese expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,\\nranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,\\nbut what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product\\nrepresented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge\\nwhose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The\\nsophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in\\nwhich we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to\\nfind the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the\\nmost accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an\\nincrease in the national level of scientific and technological competence\\nthat has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The\\nvalue of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can\\nbe estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of\\nbillions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased\\ntechnical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further\\neconomic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a\\nfactor of major importance.\\n.X\\n89\\t1\\t391\\n101\\t1\\t391\\n102\\t2\\t391\\n109\\t1\\t391\\n343\\t1\\t391\\n356\\t1\\t391\\n391\\t5\\t391\\n426\\t1\\t391\\n436\\t3\\t391\\n437\\t2\\t391\\n658\\t2\\t391\\n1050\\t3\\t391\\n1063\\t1\\t391\\n1288\\t3\\t391\\n1296\\t1\\t391\\n1339\\t1\\t391\\n1386\\t1\\t391\\n1386\\t1\\t391\\n.I 392\\n.T\\nFaculty Status for Librarians\\n.A\\nMassman, V.F.\\n.W\\n  The purpose of this study is:  (1) to\\nreview the history of the struggle for faculty status for\\nlibrarians and some of the arguments advanced in support of\\nthat objective; and (2) to gather information on the \\nsimilarities and differences between librarians and faculty \\nmembers in the broad areas of preparation, contributions,\\nand rewards.

The book begins with an\\nexplanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The\\nfundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as\\nits three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive\\ngrammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics\\nas normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of\\nautomata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.

The Turing machine is covered in\\ndetail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.

How can formal channels be\\nmanipulated to take on the characteristics of informal\\ncommunication?  To cast light on these questions the present\\npaper examines the role of informal and formal channels within\\nthe overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology,\\nconsiders the special advantages of informal communication,\\nand outlines certain relations between informal and formal\\nchannels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments\\nin scientific communication are described; one experiment being\\nbuilt about an innovation that attempts to \"informalize\" formal\\nchannels while the other is built about another innovation that,\\nin general, attempts to \"formalize\" an informal channel.\\n\\n.X\\n24\\t1\\t398\\n62\\t1\\t398\\n65\\t1\\t398\\n66\\t1\\t398\\n75\\t1\\t398\\n76\\t1\\t398\\n95\\t1\\t398\\n98\\t1\\t398\\n105\\t1\\t398\\n109\\t1\\t398\\n137\\t1\\t398\\n162\\t1\\t398\\n163\\t1\\t398\\n210\\t1\\t398\\n278\\t1\\t398\\n279\\t1\\t398\\n280\\t1\\t398\\n386\\t4\\t398\\n395\\t1\\t398\\n398\\t5\\t398\\n544\\t1\\t398\\n560\\t1\\t398\\n658\\t1\\t398\\n716\\t1\\t398\\n748\\t1\\t398\\n782\\t1\\t398\\n788\\t1\\t398\\n789\\t1\\t398\\n837\\t1\\t398\\n925\\t1\\t398\\n933\\t1\\t398\\n1063\\t1\\t398\\n1076\\t1\\t398\\n1083\\t1\\t398\\n1142\\t1\\t398\\n1270\\t1\\t398\\n1284\\t2\\t398\\n1300\\t1\\t398\\n1361\\t1\\t398\\n1400\\t1\\t398\\n1404\\t1\\t398\\n1408\\t1\\t398\\n1446\\t1\\t398\\n1447\\t1\\t398\\n1447\\t1\\t398\\n.I 399\\n.T\\nFunctional Approach\\n.A\\nSgall, P.\\n.W\\n  The present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraic\\nlinguistics being pursued at Charles University, Prague.  It is based mainly\\non P. Sgall\\'s book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a\\nsystematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has\\ngradually been elaborated by our research group.\\n  We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a\\ndefinitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an\\narticulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be\\ninteresting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics.\\nThis conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing\\nform of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take the\\nmore recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their\\nscope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses are\\ncommented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present a\\ncomplete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart\\nto the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply tried\\nto formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the\\ndevelopment of a new alternative.\\n.X\\n168\\t1\\t399\\n399\\t5\\t399\\n1225\\t1\\t399\\n1388\\t1\\t399\\n1427\\t1\\t399\\n1427\\t1\\t399\\n.I 400\\n.T\\nFuture Developments in Telecommunications\\n.A\\nMartin, J.\\n.W\\n  Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change.\\n  The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential.\\nIt will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect\\nthey will have on society.\\n  These inventions include:\\n  The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephone\\nand television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satellites\\nwill be built and will have an enormous impact on education and\\ncommunications both in the United States and throughout the world.  The\\nsatellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields\\nploughed by oxen.\\n  The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000\\nsimultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances.\\n  The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory,\\nhas the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls\\nor their equivalent.\\n  Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computer\\ncircuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of\\ncomputers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential of\\nextremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely\\nfast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can\\nbecome very low in cost.\\n  On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to many\\ndistant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human\\nthinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and information\\nof innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.\\n  Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers\\nsee as well as hear each other.\\n  Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.\\n  Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying\\ncapacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  It\\ncould be used for signals other than television.\\n  Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words and\\nspeak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtone\\ntelephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.\\n  Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above the\\nmicrowave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the\\nother radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute\\nthese millimeter-wave signals.\\n  Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone,\\nmusic, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream\\nand transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links.\\nMajor advantages accrue from this.\\n  Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into\\noperation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and\\n\"concentrating\" all types of signals.\\n  Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that\\ncan be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a\\nfraction of a second.\\n.X\\n10\\t1\\t400\\n114\\t1\\t400\\n145\\t1\\t400\\n169\\t1\\t400\\n289\\t1\\t400\\n345\\t1\\t400\\n400\\t5\\t400\\n459\\t1\\t400\\n493\\t1\\t400\\n548\\t1\\t400\\n627\\t1\\t400\\n872\\t1\\t400\\n884\\t1\\t400\\n885\\t1\\t400\\n887\\t1\\t400\\n990\\t1\\t400\\n1073\\t1\\t400\\n1227\\t1\\t400\\n1302\\t1\\t400\\n1368\\t1\\t400\\n1390\\t1\\t400\\n1392\\t1\\t400\\n1414\\t1\\t400\\n1448\\t1\\t400\\n1448\\t1\\t400\\n.I 401\\n.T\\nFuture Shock\\n.A\\nToffler, A.\\n.W\\n  This is a book about what happens to people when they are\\noverwhelmed by change.

Concomitant with this development\\nis the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports,\\ntechnical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that no\\none engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator,\\nresearcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person can\\nfunction without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in few\\nareas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aids\\nbeen so little systemized. \\n  The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well as\\nthe trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a direct\\ndescendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of published\\nmaterial has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of the\\ntwo publications; Childs\\' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately\\n400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles.\\n.X\\n6\\t1\\t403\\n363\\t1\\t403\\n403\\t5\\t403\\n461\\t1\\t403\\n551\\t1\\t403\\n551\\t1\\t403\\n.I 404\\n.T\\nA Guide to the Library of Congress Classification\\n.A\\nImmroth, J.P.\\n.W\\n  This guide is an introduction to the Library of Congress Classification; as\\nsuch, it does not include instructions for every subclass or table, but attempts\\nto provide the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of the\\nclassification, the arrangement within the classes, the format of the schedules\\nand tables, and special problems of use and notation.

The purpose of this volume is to list\\nreference books basic to research - general and special -\\nand thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for the\\nlibrary assistant, research worker, or other user of\\nlibrary resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and\\n(3) a textbook for the student, who, either in library\\nschool, training class, or college course in bibliography,\\nis pursuing a systematic study of reference books.\\n  The needs of these types of users have influenced the\\norganization and make-up of this volume, in that the\\nrequirements of the first two groups have made the\\nmanual more comprehensive than it might have been if\\nintended for a textbook only, while the introductions to\\nsections and many of the annotations have been provided\\nparticularly for the library school student.\\n.X\\n405\\t8\\t405\\n1028\\t1\\t405\\n1349\\t2\\t405\\n1349\\t2\\t405\\n.I 406\\n.T\\nGuidelines for Library Automation; a Handbook for Federal\\nand Other Libraries\\n.A\\nMarkuson, B.E.\\n.W\\n  This book is one of the products of a contract initiated by the Automation\\nTask Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by the\\nU.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development \\nCorporation.

It can be\\napproached in a number of ways:  The first three chapters outline\\ncomparative librarianship and the theoretical basis of its\\nmethodology against the wider background of other comparative sciences\\nand the scientific method.  The three chapters following are purely\\npractical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative\\nstudy.  The last chapter is intended for teachers.\\n  The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographical\\nguide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world.\\nIt draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship\\nstudents in the course of their project work, on replies to a\\nquestionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world,\\nand on Mrs. MacKee\\'s own collection of references gathered over a\\nnumber of years. \\n.X\\n323\\t1\\t407\\n407\\t9\\t407\\n407\\t9\\t407\\n.I 408\\n.T\\nHandbook of Data Processing for Libraries\\n.A\\nHayes, R.M.\\n.B\\n1970\\n.W\\n  The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians in\\nresolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  The\\nintent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods\\navailable for the application of modern data processing to library operations.\\nFor the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to\\nguide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques\\ninto his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him\\nnot only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data \\nprocessing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary\\nof the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and\\nthe technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and,\\nparticularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining\\nthe choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in\\nthe context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems,\\nas an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good\\nmanagement, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to\\neducate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems\\nof applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has\\nalready been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out\\nanalyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is\\ndeveloping better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a\\nprocess that is already underway.\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t408\\n74\\t1\\t408\\n83\\t1\\t408\\n114\\t1\\t408\\n119\\t1\\t408\\n177\\t2\\t408\\n178\\t3\\t408\\n206\\t3\\t408\\n207\\t1\\t408\\n208\\t2\\t408\\n214\\t1\\t408\\n218\\t1\\t408\\n241\\t1\\t408\\n243\\t1\\t408\\n245\\t4\\t408\\n249\\t2\\t408\\n250\\t1\\t408\\n253\\t1\\t408\\n266\\t1\\t408\\n273\\t1\\t408\\n277\\t1\\t408\\n279\\t1\\t408\\n282\\t1\\t408\\n287\\t3\\t408\\n288\\t1\\t408\\n291\\t1\\t408\\n331\\t1\\t408\\n348\\t2\\t408\\n365\\t1\\t408\\n374\\t1\\t408\\n375\\t1\\t408\\n381\\t1\\t408\\n406\\t3\\t408\\n408\\t30\\t408\\n435\\t1\\t408\\n458\\t1\\t408\\n471\\t1\\t408\\n490\\t1\\t408\\n492\\t1\\t408\\n496\\t1\\t408\\n497\\t1\\t408\\n506\\t1\\t408\\n507\\t1\\t408\\n508\\t1\\t408\\n510\\t1\\t408\\n535\\t1\\t408\\n548\\t1\\t408\\n554\\t2\\t408\\n584\\t1\\t408\\n591\\t2\\t408\\n592\\t1\\t408\\n594\\t1\\t408\\n601\\t1\\t408\\n604\\t1\\t408\\n607\\t1\\t408\\n654\\t1\\t408\\n686\\t1\\t408\\n723\\t1\\t408\\n724\\t1\\t408\\n834\\t1\\t408\\n849\\t1\\t408\\n850\\t1\\t408\\n851\\t1\\t408\\n856\\t1\\t408\\n857\\t1\\t408\\n858\\t1\\t408\\n859\\t1\\t408\\n860\\t2\\t408\\n861\\t1\\t408\\n862\\t1\\t408\\n865\\t1\\t408\\n866\\t1\\t408\\n867\\t1\\t408\\n897\\t1\\t408\\n916\\t3\\t408\\n925\\t3\\t408\\n938\\t1\\t408\\n948\\t1\\t408\\n957\\t1\\t408\\n959\\t1\\t408\\n960\\t1\\t408\\n962\\t2\\t408\\n964\\t1\\t408\\n970\\t1\\t408\\n974\\t1\\t408\\n976\\t4\\t408\\n979\\t3\\t408\\n980\\t1\\t408\\n984\\t1\\t408\\n986\\t1\\t408\\n1005\\t1\\t408\\n1007\\t5\\t408\\n1012\\t2\\t408\\n1013\\t1\\t408\\n1033\\t1\\t408\\n1035\\t1\\t408\\n1042\\t1\\t408\\n1084\\t1\\t408\\n1087\\t1\\t408\\n1148\\t1\\t408\\n1227\\t1\\t408\\n1248\\t1\\t408\\n1317\\t4\\t408\\n1327\\t2\\t408\\n1353\\t1\\t408\\n1358\\t1\\t408\\n1359\\t1\\t408\\n1360\\t1\\t408\\n1400\\t5\\t408\\n1410\\t1\\t408\\n1424\\t1\\t408\\n1445\\t1\\t408\\n1445\\t1\\t408\\n.I 409\\n.T\\nHDB of Data Processing for Libraries\\n.A\\nHayes, R.M.\\n.W\\n  The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a\\nperiod of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.

It offers practical advice to all - fledgling librarians starting\\ntheir careers, experienced librarians transferring to the field of\\nhealth sciences, established medical librarians refreshing memories or\\nadopting procedures unfamiliar to them, and specialists in related fields.\\n.X\\n192\\t1\\t410\\n215\\t1\\t410\\n410\\t5\\t410\\n949\\t2\\t410\\n1071\\t1\\t410\\n1071\\t1\\t410\\n.I 411\\n.T\\nHandbook of the National and International Libraries\\n.A\\nFang, J.R.\\n.W\\n  Two methods were used:  (1) A thorough search of professional\\nliterature, principally since 1965, with exceptions in\\ncases where no later information was available, and (2) direct\\ncommunication with associations through a questionnaire and\\nconsultation of supplementary material provided by the associations.\\nThe final result of the authors\\' search was a total of 319\\nlibrary associations, 33 international in scope and 286 national\\n(see Statistical Data).\\n.X\\n411\\t7\\t411\\n411\\t7\\t411\\n.I 412\\n.T\\nThe Hidden Dimension\\n.A\\nHall, E.T.\\n.W\\n  Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to the\\nserious reader today:  those that are content oriented, designed to\\nconvey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure,\\nthe way in which events are organized.  It is doubtful if an author \\nhas any control over which of these two types of books he writes,\\nthough it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The same\\napplies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his\\nunstated expectations.  In today\\'s world, when all of us are overwhelmed\\nwith data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people\\nare apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in\\ntheir own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awareness\\nof a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatedness\\nleads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid\\nin intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man\\nmust cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this.\\n.X\\n118\\t3\\t412\\n412\\t5\\t412\\n549\\t1\\t412\\n1034\\t1\\t412\\n1047\\t1\\t412\\n1332\\t2\\t412\\n1332\\t2\\t412\\n.I 413\\n.T\\nHistorical Introduction to Library School\\n.A\\nWhite, C.M.\\n.W\\n    This is a revision and enlargement of Origins of the American Library\\nSchool.\\n    Someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in the\\npast and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came to\\nbe what it is.  This study is less a descriptive history of library schools\\nand their work than a search for perspective within which major problems,\\nas well as the course pursued in resolving them, can be more fully\\nunderstood.  The original study, begun in 1941-42, sought to throw light\\non how library education at that time came to be what is was.  The\\npresent study continues beyond the early forming of the American library\\nschool to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization.

Much has been omitted concerning libraries and librarians\\nthat could have been included; conversely, some facts could have been\\nomitted without seriously detracting from the story as a whole but have\\nbeen included to illustrate how library history developed; they point out\\nthe high spots and indicate trends.\\n.X\\n414\\t5\\t414\\n414\\t5\\t414\\n.I 415\\n.T\\n90 Recommended Journals for the Hospital\\'s Health Science Library\\n.A\\nYast, H.T.\\n.W\\n  Choosing from the growing number of medical and paramedical journals\\nis becoming increasingly difficult for the health science librarian, the author\\nstates.

The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that\\nensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure of\\nsome fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our\\nbehavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups.\\n.X\\n19\\t2\\t416\\n44\\t2\\t416\\n57\\t2\\t416\\n76\\t1\\t416\\n81\\t1\\t416\\n175\\t1\\t416\\n228\\t3\\t416\\n309\\t1\\t416\\n318\\t1\\t416\\n321\\t2\\t416\\n324\\t2\\t416\\n329\\t4\\t416\\n359\\t3\\t416\\n416\\t17\\t416\\n442\\t3\\t416\\n450\\t3\\t416\\n453\\t1\\t416\\n477\\t1\\t416\\n495\\t2\\t416\\n498\\t1\\t416\\n511\\t5\\t416\\n521\\t1\\t416\\n524\\t3\\t416\\n563\\t1\\t416\\n565\\t2\\t416\\n567\\t2\\t416\\n591\\t1\\t416\\n700\\t1\\t416\\n748\\t1\\t416\\n759\\t2\\t416\\n765\\t3\\t416\\n778\\t2\\t416\\n787\\t1\\t416\\n791\\t3\\t416\\n835\\t2\\t416\\n851\\t2\\t416\\n852\\t1\\t416\\n862\\t2\\t416\\n867\\t1\\t416\\n872\\t1\\t416\\n875\\t2\\t416\\n893\\t1\\t416\\n894\\t1\\t416\\n970\\t1\\t416\\n1044\\t1\\t416\\n1081\\t1\\t416\\n1082\\t1\\t416\\n1083\\t1\\t416\\n1114\\t1\\t416\\n1122\\t1\\t416\\n1168\\t1\\t416\\n1172\\t2\\t416\\n1173\\t1\\t416\\n1182\\t2\\t416\\n1194\\t3\\t416\\n1196\\t1\\t416\\n1199\\t2\\t416\\n1201\\t1\\t416\\n1226\\t2\\t416\\n1309\\t1\\t416\\n1327\\t1\\t416\\n1381\\t1\\t416\\n1396\\t1\\t416\\n1398\\t1\\t416\\n1398\\t1\\t416\\n.I 417\\n.T\\nHuman Problem Solving\\n.A\\nNewell, A.\\nSimon, H.A.\\n.W\\n    The present study is concerned with the performance of intelligent adults\\nin our own culture.  The tasks discussed are short (half-hour), moderately\\ndifficult problems of a symbolic nature.  The three main tasks we use - chess,\\nsymbolic logic, and algebra-like puzzles (called cryptarithmetic puzzles) -\\ntypify this class of problems.  The study is concerned with the integrated\\nactivities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concerned\\nwith perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables.\\nThe study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with\\nlearning, and not at all with development or differences related to age.\\nFinally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the\\ndetails of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is,\\nhalf a second or less).

They determine\\nalso the quality of its successive generations of management.\\n    Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility\\nand the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management\\nis:  \"What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about\\nthe most effective way to manage people?\"  From the answer to this\\nquestion flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our\\ndiscussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many\\nother questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to\\nachieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It\\nwill be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions\\nabout the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate.\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t418\\n173\\t1\\t418\\n227\\t1\\t418\\n270\\t1\\t418\\n285\\t1\\t418\\n293\\t1\\t418\\n296\\t1\\t418\\n298\\t2\\t418\\n301\\t1\\t418\\n302\\t1\\t418\\n306\\t1\\t418\\n401\\t1\\t418\\n418\\t13\\t418\\n549\\t1\\t418\\n578\\t1\\t418\\n768\\t1\\t418\\n774\\t1\\t418\\n823\\t1\\t418\\n842\\t1\\t418\\n843\\t1\\t418\\n844\\t1\\t418\\n925\\t1\\t418\\n1015\\t1\\t418\\n1041\\t1\\t418\\n1069\\t4\\t418\\n1070\\t5\\t418\\n1150\\t2\\t418\\n1186\\t1\\t418\\n1187\\t1\\t418\\n1205\\t2\\t418\\n1214\\t2\\t418\\n1233\\t1\\t418\\n1454\\t1\\t418\\n1455\\t3\\t418\\n1455\\t3\\t418\\n.I 419\\n.T\\nA Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary \\nInformation\\n.A\\nLuhn, H.P.\\n.W\\n   Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical \\nprobability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that\\ncombination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since this\\nprocess varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed\\nof different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem\\nof literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A \\nstatistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps\\nof a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the \\nstatistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the \\nestablishment of a set of \"notions\" and the vocabulary by which they are\\nexpressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the\\nautomatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary,\\nthe encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the \\nrecording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern \\nfor finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines\\nto carry out a search..\\n.X\\n26\\t3\\t419\\n30\\t1\\t419\\n45\\t1\\t419\\n51\\t2\\t419\\n61\\t1\\t419\\n75\\t1\\t419\\n79\\t1\\t419\\n114\\t1\\t419\\n144\\t1\\t419\\n164\\t1\\t419\\n172\\t1\\t419\\n174\\t1\\t419\\n175\\t1\\t419\\n176\\t3\\t419\\n178\\t1\\t419\\n315\\t2\\t419\\n321\\t1\\t419\\n363\\t1\\t419\\n374\\t1\\t419\\n389\\t1\\t419\\n419\\t9\\t419\\n420\\t1\\t419\\n421\\t1\\t419\\n434\\t1\\t419\\n441\\t1\\t419\\n458\\t1\\t419\\n479\\t1\\t419\\n481\\t1\\t419\\n483\\t1\\t419\\n485\\t1\\t419\\n491\\t1\\t419\\n507\\t1\\t419\\n520\\t1\\t419\\n523\\t1\\t419\\n531\\t1\\t419\\n562\\t3\\t419\\n564\\t2\\t419\\n565\\t2\\t419\\n566\\t1\\t419\\n575\\t1\\t419\\n577\\t3\\t419\\n623\\t1\\t419\\n644\\t2\\t419\\n649\\t1\\t419\\n660\\t5\\t419\\n661\\t2\\t419\\n662\\t4\\t419\\n663\\t2\\t419\\n664\\t3\\t419\\n752\\t1\\t419\\n769\\t1\\t419\\n780\\t1\\t419\\n812\\t3\\t419\\n822\\t1\\t419\\n824\\t2\\t419\\n907\\t1\\t419\\n956\\t1\\t419\\n1144\\t1\\t419\\n1218\\t1\\t419\\n1279\\t1\\t419\\n1282\\t1\\t419\\n1294\\t1\\t419\\n1327\\t2\\t419\\n1414\\t1\\t419\\n1448\\t1\\t419\\n1448\\t1\\t419\\n.I 420\\n.T\\nThe Automatic Creation of Literature Abstracts\\n.A\\nLuhn, H.P.\\n.W\\n   Experts of technical papers and magazine articles that serve the purposes of\\nconventional abstracts have been created entirely by automatic means..

Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seek\\nthe highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and the\\ngreatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict the\\nmanager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, \\nand minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, \\nthe research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production \\nproblem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. \\nThis  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess\\' approach to project\\nselection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-product\\nfactory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve\\nthese project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination \\nproblems..

Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional \\nlaboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support the\\na priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of\\ninformation are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need,\\nproblem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or\\ntechnique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the \\nopportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative\\nthought proposed by other investigators..

An experiment was\\nconducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company to\\nmeasure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts.\\nThe results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain\\ntypes of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape\\nof polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of success\\nforecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than\\nseveral commonly used project status measures.  These results tend\\nto support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models that\\nare based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used\\nby management to aid in early identification of eventually failing\\nprojects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding. \\n.X\\n423\\t2\\t427\\n424\\t1\\t427\\n425\\t2\\t427\\n426\\t1\\t427\\n427\\t6\\t427\\n428\\t1\\t427\\n561\\t1\\t427\\n1039\\t2\\t427\\n1040\\t1\\t427\\n1449\\t1\\t427\\n1449\\t1\\t427\\n.I 428\\n.T\\nAnalysis of Some Portfolio Selection Models for R&D\\n.A\\nGear, A.E.\\nLockett, A.G.\\nPearson, A.W.\\n.W\\n   This paper presents the analytical review of mathematical programming models\\nthat have been proposed as aids to the related problems of resources allocation \\nand project selection in R&D..

Many people have already drawn attention to\\nparticular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report\\ndid not consider that there was any up-to-date assessment of the problem\\nwhich attempted to look at it as a whole, in all its variety and complexity.\\nHence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us;\\nan investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British\\nindustry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first\\nimpression and summary.\\n.X\\n312\\t1\\t437\\n356\\t2\\t437\\n391\\t2\\t437\\n423\\t1\\t437\\n424\\t1\\t437\\n425\\t1\\t437\\n426\\t1\\t437\\n436\\t4\\t437\\n437\\t5\\t437\\n561\\t1\\t437\\n658\\t2\\t437\\n1036\\t1\\t437\\n1039\\t1\\t437\\n1040\\t1\\t437\\n1041\\t1\\t437\\n1050\\t2\\t437\\n1154\\t1\\t437\\n1187\\t1\\t437\\n1288\\t2\\t437\\n1333\\t1\\t437\\n1406\\t1\\t437\\n1406\\t1\\t437\\n.I 438\\n.T\\nInequality; a reassessment of the effect of family and schooling in America\\n.A\\nJenchs, C.\\n.W\\n  This book summarizes the results of three years of research at the\\nCenter for Educational Policy Research.

The \\npresent article examines the continuity of scientific work and information \\nexchange by \"productive scientists\" two years after the publication of their \\narticles in 1968/1969..

Though problems of disputed\\nauthorship are common in history, literature, and politics, scholars regard their\\nsolutions as minor advances.  For us the question of whether Hamilton or\\nMadison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and\\ndemonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods.\\nWhile we help solve this historical problem, our practical application of Bayes\\'\\ntheorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a\\nmethod being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics.  Furthermore,\\nlarge practical applications have until now been few, and our work helps fill\\nthat gap.\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t441\\n51\\t1\\t441\\n69\\t1\\t441\\n75\\t1\\t441\\n79\\t3\\t441\\n226\\t1\\t441\\n315\\t1\\t441\\n324\\t2\\t441\\n419\\t1\\t441\\n441\\t7\\t441\\n518\\t1\\t441\\n531\\t1\\t441\\n575\\t2\\t441\\n577\\t2\\t441\\n644\\t1\\t441\\n649\\t1\\t441\\n660\\t3\\t441\\n752\\t1\\t441\\n755\\t1\\t441\\n780\\t1\\t441\\n812\\t1\\t441\\n824\\t1\\t441\\n956\\t1\\t441\\n1084\\t1\\t441\\n1202\\t1\\t441\\n1282\\t2\\t441\\n1294\\t2\\t441\\n1294\\t2\\t441\\n.I 442\\n.T\\nStorage Analysis of a Compression Coding for Document Data Bases\\n.A\\nHeaps, H.S.\\n.W\\n   Analysis is made of the effect of using an efficient code of compression of\\nterms within a document data base..

As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function\\nmL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of \\nmembership, mL(x,y), in L.. \\n   Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy\\nset, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y)..\\nThe fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing \\nthe role of a name for M(x)..\\n   If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is,\\nx = x1 ... xn, xi  T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in \\nterms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by\\nsolving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are \\ndeduced from the syntax tree of x.. The use of this approach is illustrated by \\nexamples..\\n.X\\n168\\t1\\t443\\n317\\t1\\t443\\n332\\t1\\t443\\n397\\t3\\t443\\n417\\t4\\t443\\n430\\t4\\t443\\n443\\t5\\t443\\n455\\t4\\t443\\n464\\t3\\t443\\n546\\t1\\t443\\n572\\t1\\t443\\n608\\t1\\t443\\n745\\t4\\t443\\n902\\t1\\t443\\n1046\\t1\\t443\\n1204\\t3\\t443\\n1327\\t1\\t443\\n1398\\t4\\t443\\n1399\\t1\\t443\\n1427\\t3\\t443\\n1427\\t3\\t443\\n.I 444\\n.T\\nOn Relevance as a Measure\\n.A\\nCoffman, William\\n.W\\n   Relevance is defined as a measure of information conveyed by a document \\nrelative to a query..

Unfortunately,\\nhowever, there is at present no consensus as to how this notion should be \\ndefined.. The purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of\\nwhat it means to say that a piece of stored information is \"relevant\" to the\\ninformation need of a retrieval system user..\\n   The suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical \\nimplication.. For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with\\none of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a \\nmathematically precise criterion of relevance.. For other types of fact \\nretrieval systems and reference retrieval systems, including all systems whose \\nstored information is expressed in natural language, the definition is not  \\nmathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual \\nlevel..\\n.X\\n29\\t2\\t445\\n35\\t1\\t445\\n42\\t1\\t445\\n43\\t1\\t445\\n57\\t1\\t445\\n58\\t2\\t445\\n70\\t1\\t445\\n73\\t1\\t445\\n84\\t1\\t445\\n117\\t1\\t445\\n161\\t1\\t445\\n165\\t2\\t445\\n197\\t1\\t445\\n259\\t1\\t445\\n274\\t1\\t445\\n375\\t1\\t445\\n381\\t1\\t445\\n390\\t1\\t445\\n434\\t1\\t445\\n444\\t2\\t445\\n445\\t14\\t445\\n447\\t3\\t445\\n449\\t4\\t445\\n451\\t1\\t445\\n454\\t1\\t445\\n457\\t1\\t445\\n472\\t1\\t445\\n474\\t1\\t445\\n476\\t1\\t445\\n486\\t1\\t445\\n503\\t1\\t445\\n506\\t1\\t445\\n507\\t1\\t445\\n523\\t1\\t445\\n525\\t1\\t445\\n532\\t2\\t445\\n554\\t2\\t445\\n577\\t1\\t445\\n579\\t1\\t445\\n590\\t2\\t445\\n591\\t1\\t445\\n593\\t1\\t445\\n594\\t1\\t445\\n595\\t1\\t445\\n596\\t1\\t445\\n597\\t1\\t445\\n599\\t1\\t445\\n600\\t1\\t445\\n603\\t1\\t445\\n604\\t1\\t445\\n606\\t1\\t445\\n609\\t1\\t445\\n621\\t1\\t445\\n625\\t3\\t445\\n634\\t1\\t445\\n643\\t1\\t445\\n644\\t1\\t445\\n649\\t1\\t445\\n652\\t1\\t445\\n656\\t1\\t445\\n660\\t3\\t445\\n668\\t1\\t445\\n670\\t1\\t445\\n671\\t1\\t445\\n674\\t1\\t445\\n683\\t1\\t445\\n689\\t2\\t445\\n715\\t1\\t445\\n723\\t1\\t445\\n724\\t1\\t445\\n752\\t1\\t445\\n754\\t1\\t445\\n762\\t2\\t445\\n764\\t1\\t445\\n780\\t1\\t445\\n785\\t2\\t445\\n797\\t1\\t445\\n801\\t1\\t445\\n805\\t1\\t445\\n806\\t1\\t445\\n812\\t1\\t445\\n814\\t1\\t445\\n819\\t1\\t445\\n829\\t1\\t445\\n830\\t1\\t445\\n836\\t1\\t445\\n866\\t1\\t445\\n867\\t1\\t445\\n874\\t1\\t445\\n893\\t1\\t445\\n895\\t1\\t445\\n901\\t1\\t445\\n956\\t1\\t445\\n989\\t1\\t445\\n1016\\t1\\t445\\n1030\\t1\\t445\\n1045\\t1\\t445\\n1077\\t2\\t445\\n1084\\t1\\t445\\n1195\\t1\\t445\\n1201\\t2\\t445\\n1215\\t1\\t445\\n1231\\t2\\t445\\n1235\\t1\\t445\\n1255\\t1\\t445\\n1265\\t1\\t445\\n1281\\t1\\t445\\n1282\\t2\\t445\\n1285\\t1\\t445\\n1298\\t1\\t445\\n1299\\t1\\t445\\n1327\\t2\\t445\\n1386\\t1\\t445\\n1405\\t1\\t445\\n1448\\t1\\t445\\n1448\\t1\\t445\\n.I 446\\n.T\\nComputer Assisted Indexing\\n.A\\nGray, W. A.\\n.W\\n   The paper describes a technique which enables an on line computer based\\ninformation retrieval system to aid the indexers by selecting possible index \\nterms to be assigned to a new document entering the system..\\n   The method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the \\nnew article.. This produces a list of index terms weighted according to their \\nexpected correlation with the subject matter of the new article.. Thus, the \\nindexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an \\naid..\\n   An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial\\nset of documents.. These documents have already been indexed for the MEDLARS \\nsystem..

Both attempts only partially\\nsucceed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content\\nrelevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has\\nvalidity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less\\nprecise language; for example, in defining \"second order noise,\" she uses the\\nambiguous phrase \"a formally relevant document which is not really relevant\" -\\npresumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of\\nthe enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, \"no account is taken of\\nthe subjective relevance (pertinence).\"  Yet this is surely the true aim of the\\nsystem.\\n.X\\n15\\t1\\t447\\n29\\t1\\t447\\n35\\t1\\t447\\n42\\t1\\t447\\n43\\t1\\t447\\n58\\t1\\t447\\n70\\t1\\t447\\n84\\t1\\t447\\n152\\t1\\t447\\n313\\t1\\t447\\n444\\t2\\t447\\n445\\t3\\t447\\n447\\t7\\t447\\n449\\t3\\t447\\n474\\t1\\t447\\n486\\t1\\t447\\n514\\t1\\t447\\n523\\t1\\t447\\n532\\t2\\t447\\n554\\t1\\t447\\n557\\t1\\t447\\n574\\t1\\t447\\n625\\t2\\t447\\n639\\t1\\t447\\n660\\t1\\t447\\n740\\t1\\t447\\n741\\t1\\t447\\n752\\t1\\t447\\n762\\t1\\t447\\n764\\t1\\t447\\n803\\t1\\t447\\n806\\t1\\t447\\n893\\t1\\t447\\n1016\\t1\\t447\\n1030\\t1\\t447\\n1045\\t1\\t447\\n1084\\t1\\t447\\n1195\\t1\\t447\\n1201\\t1\\t447\\n1235\\t1\\t447\\n1281\\t1\\t447\\n1285\\t1\\t447\\n1319\\t1\\t447\\n1327\\t1\\t447\\n1386\\t1\\t447\\n1386\\t1\\t447\\n.I 448\\n.T\\nAn Evaluation of Query Expansion by the Addition of Clustered Terms \\n   for a Document Retrieval System\\n.A\\nMinker, Jack\\nWilson, Gerald A.\\nZimmerman, Barbara H.\\n.W\\n   An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be \\nextracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of \\nemploying such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph \\ntheoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different \\ncluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The \\nclusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to \\ndetermine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results..\\n   Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were\\nobtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance \\nwere achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the \\nretrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be\\nobtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters \\nand adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use\\nin an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and \\nthe  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or \\nother  situations..\\n.X\\n51\\t1\\t448\\n69\\t1\\t448\\n71\\t2\\t448\\n77\\t2\\t448\\n79\\t2\\t448\\n124\\t1\\t448\\n125\\t1\\t448\\n165\\t1\\t448\\n168\\t1\\t448\\n175\\t2\\t448\\n176\\t2\\t448\\n315\\t1\\t448\\n381\\t1\\t448\\n382\\t1\\t448\\n448\\t6\\t448\\n452\\t1\\t448\\n462\\t1\\t448\\n480\\t1\\t448\\n483\\t1\\t448\\n484\\t2\\t448\\n486\\t1\\t448\\n488\\t2\\t448\\n491\\t1\\t448\\n493\\t1\\t448\\n503\\t1\\t448\\n507\\t1\\t448\\n509\\t2\\t448\\n510\\t1\\t448\\n511\\t1\\t448\\n512\\t1\\t448\\n516\\t1\\t448\\n517\\t1\\t448\\n518\\t1\\t448\\n520\\t1\\t448\\n521\\t1\\t448\\n522\\t2\\t448\\n523\\t1\\t448\\n526\\t1\\t448\\n527\\t2\\t448\\n528\\t2\\t448\\n529\\t1\\t448\\n531\\t1\\t448\\n565\\t3\\t448\\n566\\t1\\t448\\n575\\t1\\t448\\n581\\t1\\t448\\n596\\t1\\t448\\n603\\t1\\t448\\n608\\t1\\t448\\n610\\t1\\t448\\n615\\t1\\t448\\n625\\t1\\t448\\n626\\t1\\t448\\n633\\t1\\t448\\n636\\t1\\t448\\n659\\t3\\t448\\n660\\t1\\t448\\n700\\t1\\t448\\n705\\t1\\t448\\n707\\t1\\t448\\n715\\t1\\t448\\n727\\t1\\t448\\n754\\t2\\t448\\n790\\t1\\t448\\n805\\t1\\t448\\n809\\t1\\t448\\n810\\t2\\t448\\n812\\t2\\t448\\n813\\t1\\t448\\n814\\t1\\t448\\n817\\t2\\t448\\n824\\t2\\t448\\n825\\t1\\t448\\n875\\t1\\t448\\n894\\t2\\t448\\n1051\\t1\\t448\\n1202\\t1\\t448\\n1294\\t2\\t448\\n1303\\t1\\t448\\n1327\\t2\\t448\\n1364\\t1\\t448\\n1366\\t1\\t448\\n1367\\t1\\t448\\n1368\\t1\\t448\\n1419\\t1\\t448\\n1427\\t1\\t448\\n1427\\t1\\t448\\n.I 449\\n.T\\nSituational Relevance\\n.A\\nWilson, Patrick\\n.W\\n   The concept of situational relevance is introduced, based on W.S.Cooper\\'s\\ndefinitions of logical relevance, on the notion of evidential relevance drawn\\nfrom inductive logic, on the notions of a personal stock of knowledge and a set \\nof personal concerns, the latter explained in terms of preferences over ranges \\nof alternatives..

Other relevant material about the use made\\nof information is discussed in Chapter 4 on systematic approaches.\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t456\\n9\\t1\\t456\\n32\\t1\\t456\\n48\\t3\\t456\\n95\\t1\\t456\\n96\\t1\\t456\\n98\\t2\\t456\\n102\\t1\\t456\\n104\\t1\\t456\\n106\\t1\\t456\\n110\\t1\\t456\\n111\\t2\\t456\\n112\\t1\\t456\\n113\\t1\\t456\\n131\\t1\\t456\\n137\\t2\\t456\\n163\\t1\\t456\\n170\\t1\\t456\\n175\\t1\\t456\\n207\\t1\\t456\\n224\\t1\\t456\\n298\\t1\\t456\\n311\\t1\\t456\\n312\\t1\\t456\\n345\\t1\\t456\\n381\\t1\\t456\\n439\\t1\\t456\\n440\\t1\\t456\\n456\\t15\\t456\\n458\\t1\\t456\\n514\\t1\\t456\\n533\\t2\\t456\\n545\\t1\\t456\\n554\\t1\\t456\\n560\\t1\\t456\\n575\\t1\\t456\\n579\\t1\\t456\\n591\\t1\\t456\\n595\\t1\\t456\\n599\\t1\\t456\\n603\\t1\\t456\\n607\\t1\\t456\\n615\\t1\\t456\\n619\\t1\\t456\\n620\\t1\\t456\\n621\\t1\\t456\\n625\\t1\\t456\\n630\\t1\\t456\\n752\\t1\\t456\\n760\\t1\\t456\\n768\\t1\\t456\\n772\\t1\\t456\\n774\\t1\\t456\\n780\\t1\\t456\\n783\\t1\\t456\\n793\\t2\\t456\\n799\\t1\\t456\\n803\\t1\\t456\\n811\\t1\\t456\\n816\\t1\\t456\\n822\\t1\\t456\\n837\\t1\\t456\\n900\\t2\\t456\\n907\\t1\\t456\\n913\\t1\\t456\\n961\\t1\\t456\\n962\\t1\\t456\\n964\\t1\\t456\\n968\\t1\\t456\\n1030\\t1\\t456\\n1032\\t2\\t456\\n1045\\t1\\t456\\n1056\\t2\\t456\\n1062\\t1\\t456\\n1068\\t1\\t456\\n1203\\t1\\t456\\n1238\\t1\\t456\\n1254\\t1\\t456\\n1285\\t1\\t456\\n1287\\t1\\t456\\n1291\\t1\\t456\\n1296\\t1\\t456\\n1321\\t1\\t456\\n1338\\t1\\t456\\n1340\\t1\\t456\\n1344\\t1\\t456\\n1346\\t1\\t456\\n1347\\t1\\t456\\n1407\\t1\\t456\\n1445\\t1\\t456\\n1445\\t1\\t456\\n.I 457\\n.T\\nInformation, Mechanism, and Meaning\\n.A\\nMackay, D.M.\\n.W\\n  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to\\nkeep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the\\npublication of collected papers, like the estate of holy\\nmatrimony, is something not to be undertaken \\'unadvisedly,\\nlightly or wantonly\\'.  In the present case it would not have been\\nconsidered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected\\nfriend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement\\nalone overcame that distaste which most of us feel\\nfor our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this\\nfirst volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these\\nexploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably \\nawkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to\\nfollow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were\\nwritten for specific occasions, each of which demanded some\\nrehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting\\nrepetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional\\nexceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only\\nat the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution\\nadopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages\\nintact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped\\nwithout loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some\\ncomment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or \\npostscript to the original papers, the passages added have\\nbeen italicized. \\n.X\\n3\\t1\\t457\\n58\\t1\\t457\\n85\\t1\\t457\\n274\\t1\\t457\\n361\\t1\\t457\\n445\\t1\\t457\\n457\\t5\\t457\\n467\\t1\\t457\\n604\\t1\\t457\\n660\\t1\\t457\\n665\\t1\\t457\\n803\\t1\\t457\\n911\\t1\\t457\\n1037\\t1\\t457\\n1045\\t1\\t457\\n1309\\t1\\t457\\n1309\\t1\\t457\\n.I 458\\n.T\\nInformation Retrieval Systems\\n.A\\nLancaster, F.W.\\n.W\\n  This book is concerned primarily with those \"intellectual\" factors that\\nsignificantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems;\\nnamely,\\n\\n        - indexing policy and practice\\n        - vocabulary control\\n        - searching strategies\\n        - interaction between the system and its users\\n\\n  My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.

The subject of information retrieval per se\\nbegins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship \\nand documentation.

Chapter Seven presents a simplified\\nconcept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for\\ndiscussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially\\nfor data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.\\nChapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user\\nstudies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have\\ndeveloped strongly since 1963.\\n\\n.X\\n6\\t1\\t461\\n125\\t1\\t461\\n127\\t1\\t461\\n129\\t1\\t461\\n363\\t2\\t461\\n403\\t1\\t461\\n432\\t1\\t461\\n460\\t1\\t461\\n461\\t6\\t461\\n551\\t1\\t461\\n580\\t1\\t461\\n622\\t1\\t461\\n642\\t1\\t461\\n643\\t1\\t461\\n644\\t1\\t461\\n645\\t1\\t461\\n646\\t1\\t461\\n649\\t1\\t461\\n650\\t1\\t461\\n708\\t1\\t461\\n736\\t1\\t461\\n737\\t1\\t461\\n738\\t1\\t461\\n739\\t1\\t461\\n741\\t1\\t461\\n1374\\t1\\t461\\n1376\\t1\\t461\\n1376\\t1\\t461\\n.I 462\\n.T\\nInformation Retrieval\\n.A\\nVan Rijsbergen, C.J.\\n.W\\n  The material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate\\ninformation (or computer) science students, postgraduate library\\nscience students, and research workers in the field of IR.

For example, the relation \\nx >> y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers..\\n   More correctly, a similarity relation, S is a fuzzy relation which is\\nreflexive, symmetric, and transitive..\\n   Various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are \\ninvestigated and, as an illustration, an extended version of Szpilrajn\\'s \\ntheorem is proved..\\n.X\\n175\\t1\\t464\\n179\\t1\\t464\\n397\\t3\\t464\\n417\\t3\\t464\\n430\\t4\\t464\\n443\\t3\\t464\\n455\\t6\\t464\\n464\\t7\\t464\\n509\\t1\\t464\\n564\\t1\\t464\\n566\\t1\\t464\\n745\\t3\\t464\\n853\\t1\\t464\\n1117\\t1\\t464\\n1140\\t1\\t464\\n1204\\t3\\t464\\n1398\\t3\\t464\\n1427\\t3\\t464\\n1427\\t3\\t464\\n.I 465\\n.T\\nUsing Commercially Available Literature Tapes \\n for a Current Awareness Service \\n.A\\nCorbett, L.\\n.W\\n   The paper reviews the need for current awareness services and describes the \\nbasic characteristics of SDI, indicating its advantages..

The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time\\nspent in research or research related activities..

The best-known example of the articulated subject \\nindex is that to Chemical Abstracts..\\n   It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it \\nappears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was \\nfirst compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to \\ngenerate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more \\nprepositions or connectives..\\n   A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject \\nindex entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives\\nor words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been \\ndeveloped, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to \\ngreatest organization in the index display..\\n   Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The \\npotential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval \\nis examined..\\n.X\\n29\\t1\\t480\\n34\\t1\\t480\\n49\\t1\\t480\\n51\\t1\\t480\\n53\\t1\\t480\\n54\\t1\\t480\\n68\\t1\\t480\\n69\\t2\\t480\\n71\\t1\\t480\\n77\\t1\\t480\\n79\\t1\\t480\\n86\\t1\\t480\\n150\\t1\\t480\\n168\\t1\\t480\\n175\\t2\\t480\\n176\\t1\\t480\\n194\\t1\\t480\\n252\\t1\\t480\\n258\\t1\\t480\\n261\\t1\\t480\\n315\\t1\\t480\\n346\\t1\\t480\\n347\\t1\\t480\\n371\\t2\\t480\\n382\\t2\\t480\\n448\\t1\\t480\\n458\\t1\\t480\\n465\\t2\\t480\\n466\\t1\\t480\\n476\\t1\\t480\\n477\\t1\\t480\\n478\\t4\\t480\\n479\\t1\\t480\\n480\\t13\\t480\\n483\\t1\\t480\\n484\\t2\\t480\\n485\\t1\\t480\\n486\\t1\\t480\\n488\\t1\\t480\\n491\\t1\\t480\\n493\\t1\\t480\\n503\\t1\\t480\\n507\\t1\\t480\\n509\\t1\\t480\\n510\\t1\\t480\\n512\\t1\\t480\\n517\\t1\\t480\\n520\\t1\\t480\\n522\\t1\\t480\\n527\\t1\\t480\\n528\\t1\\t480\\n531\\t1\\t480\\n565\\t2\\t480\\n566\\t2\\t480\\n581\\t1\\t480\\n596\\t1\\t480\\n603\\t1\\t480\\n608\\t1\\t480\\n633\\t1\\t480\\n659\\t1\\t480\\n674\\t1\\t480\\n680\\t2\\t480\\n681\\t1\\t480\\n682\\t1\\t480\\n704\\t2\\t480\\n711\\t1\\t480\\n714\\t1\\t480\\n715\\t4\\t480\\n716\\t1\\t480\\n717\\t1\\t480\\n746\\t2\\t480\\n748\\t1\\t480\\n754\\t1\\t480\\n758\\t2\\t480\\n781\\t2\\t480\\n790\\t1\\t480\\n805\\t1\\t480\\n809\\t1\\t480\\n810\\t1\\t480\\n812\\t1\\t480\\n813\\t1\\t480\\n814\\t1\\t480\\n817\\t2\\t480\\n824\\t1\\t480\\n825\\t2\\t480\\n894\\t1\\t480\\n1024\\t1\\t480\\n1051\\t1\\t480\\n1054\\t1\\t480\\n1118\\t1\\t480\\n1175\\t1\\t480\\n1215\\t4\\t480\\n1279\\t1\\t480\\n1294\\t1\\t480\\n1327\\t1\\t480\\n1391\\t1\\t480\\n1405\\t1\\t480\\n1419\\t1\\t480\\n1427\\t1\\t480\\n1427\\t1\\t480\\n.I 481\\n.T\\nIntegrated Information Processing and the Case for a National Network\\n.A\\nDammers, H.

E.\\nSalton, G.\\n.W\\n   Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information \\nretrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the \\ndetermination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents \\nwhich are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that\\nquery, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid \\nevaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..\\n   A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance \\nassessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure \\nretrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information \\nscience for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the \\nrelevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall \\nand precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision \\ndata may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many \\ndistinct user classes..\\n.X\\n28\\t2\\t486\\n29\\t1\\t486\\n35\\t1\\t486\\n42\\t1\\t486\\n43\\t2\\t486\\n45\\t1\\t486\\n50\\t1\\t486\\n51\\t1\\t486\\n58\\t1\\t486\\n69\\t1\\t486\\n70\\t1\\t486\\n71\\t2\\t486\\n72\\t1\\t486\\n73\\t1\\t486\\n74\\t1\\t486\\n75\\t2\\t486\\n77\\t2\\t486\\n78\\t1\\t486\\n79\\t2\\t486\\n81\\t1\\t486\\n82\\t1\\t486\\n83\\t1\\t486\\n84\\t1\\t486\\n86\\t1\\t486\\n149\\t1\\t486\\n153\\t1\\t486\\n156\\t1\\t486\\n168\\t1\\t486\\n175\\t2\\t486\\n176\\t1\\t486\\n211\\t1\\t486\\n212\\t1\\t486\\n245\\t1\\t486\\n277\\t1\\t486\\n279\\t1\\t486\\n280\\t1\\t486\\n315\\t1\\t486\\n382\\t1\\t486\\n444\\t1\\t486\\n445\\t1\\t486\\n447\\t1\\t486\\n448\\t1\\t486\\n449\\t1\\t486\\n474\\t1\\t486\\n480\\t1\\t486\\n483\\t1\\t486\\n484\\t1\\t486\\n486\\t8\\t486\\n487\\t1\\t486\\n488\\t1\\t486\\n491\\t1\\t486\\n493\\t1\\t486\\n503\\t1\\t486\\n507\\t1\\t486\\n509\\t1\\t486\\n510\\t1\\t486\\n512\\t1\\t486\\n517\\t1\\t486\\n520\\t1\\t486\\n522\\t1\\t486\\n527\\t1\\t486\\n528\\t1\\t486\\n531\\t1\\t486\\n532\\t1\\t486\\n565\\t1\\t486\\n566\\t1\\t486\\n581\\t1\\t486\\n596\\t1\\t486\\n603\\t1\\t486\\n608\\t1\\t486\\n625\\t1\\t486\\n633\\t1\\t486\\n659\\t1\\t486\\n660\\t1\\t486\\n715\\t1\\t486\\n720\\t1\\t486\\n748\\t1\\t486\\n754\\t1\\t486\\n762\\t1\\t486\\n764\\t1\\t486\\n781\\t1\\t486\\n785\\t1\\t486\\n786\\t1\\t486\\n787\\t1\\t486\\n788\\t1\\t486\\n789\\t1\\t486\\n790\\t1\\t486\\n791\\t1\\t486\\n795\\t1\\t486\\n805\\t1\\t486\\n809\\t1\\t486\\n810\\t1\\t486\\n812\\t1\\t486\\n813\\t1\\t486\\n814\\t1\\t486\\n817\\t1\\t486\\n824\\t1\\t486\\n825\\t1\\t486\\n853\\t1\\t486\\n893\\t1\\t486\\n894\\t1\\t486\\n925\\t1\\t486\\n984\\t1\\t486\\n1016\\t1\\t486\\n1030\\t1\\t486\\n1045\\t1\\t486\\n1051\\t1\\t486\\n1084\\t1\\t486\\n1195\\t1\\t486\\n1201\\t1\\t486\\n1235\\t1\\t486\\n1255\\t1\\t486\\n1277\\t1\\t486\\n1280\\t1\\t486\\n1281\\t1\\t486\\n1285\\t2\\t486\\n1287\\t1\\t486\\n1294\\t1\\t486\\n1327\\t1\\t486\\n1414\\t1\\t486\\n1419\\t1\\t486\\n1427\\t1\\t486\\n1427\\t1\\t486\\n.I 487\\n.T\\nAn Indirect Method of Information Retrieval\\n.A\\nGoffman, William\\n.W\\n   The information retrieval process, treated strictly as a matching procedure,\\nhas the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query, and that it\\noverlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document \\ndepends upon what is already known about the subject, and in term affects the \\nrelevance of other documents subsequently examined..

While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive \\nbasis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining \\nand selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are \\nproposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and \\nexclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of\\n\"good index terms\", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms\\nfor their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the \\nprinciple of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not \\nachieved in this study..

F.\\n.W\\n   The economic merits of applying computers in information storage, retrieval \\nand dissemination have usually been considered with respect only to the cost of \\noperating the information services concerned.. This had tended to indicate that\\ncomputer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in \\nthe large scale organizations..\\n   The present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costs\\ninvolved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system \\nrepresenting the information services and its users.. It is suggested that the \\ninclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information \\ngathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer application\\nin information work..\\n   In fact, such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic \\njustification    in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize \\nthe total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users..\\n   To illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in \\nresearch data handling and the operation of SDI services in an industrial \\nresearch establishment..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t490\\n27\\t1\\t490\\n34\\t1\\t490\\n38\\t1\\t490\\n49\\t1\\t490\\n53\\t1\\t490\\n59\\t1\\t490\\n74\\t2\\t490\\n83\\t2\\t490\\n84\\t1\\t490\\n158\\t1\\t490\\n164\\t2\\t490\\n202\\t1\\t490\\n213\\t1\\t490\\n224\\t1\\t490\\n243\\t1\\t490\\n245\\t1\\t490\\n273\\t1\\t490\\n279\\t1\\t490\\n288\\t1\\t490\\n331\\t1\\t490\\n381\\t2\\t490\\n408\\t1\\t490\\n421\\t1\\t490\\n465\\t1\\t490\\n466\\t1\\t490\\n467\\t1\\t490\\n481\\t1\\t490\\n488\\t1\\t490\\n489\\t1\\t490\\n490\\t9\\t490\\n491\\t7\\t490\\n492\\t4\\t490\\n493\\t1\\t490\\n494\\t1\\t490\\n495\\t3\\t490\\n496\\t4\\t490\\n497\\t3\\t490\\n498\\t1\\t490\\n499\\t1\\t490\\n500\\t1\\t490\\n506\\t2\\t490\\n507\\t1\\t490\\n510\\t1\\t490\\n512\\t2\\t490\\n581\\t2\\t490\\n583\\t1\\t490\\n584\\t2\\t490\\n586\\t1\\t490\\n591\\t3\\t490\\n592\\t1\\t490\\n595\\t1\\t490\\n603\\t1\\t490\\n604\\t1\\t490\\n609\\t1\\t490\\n622\\t1\\t490\\n623\\t1\\t490\\n629\\t1\\t490\\n633\\t1\\t490\\n639\\t1\\t490\\n659\\t2\\t490\\n676\\t1\\t490\\n689\\t1\\t490\\n711\\t1\\t490\\n722\\t1\\t490\\n723\\t3\\t490\\n724\\t1\\t490\\n726\\t1\\t490\\n727\\t1\\t490\\n728\\t1\\t490\\n730\\t1\\t490\\n731\\t1\\t490\\n732\\t1\\t490\\n795\\t1\\t490\\n801\\t1\\t490\\n809\\t1\\t490\\n810\\t1\\t490\\n813\\t2\\t490\\n814\\t2\\t490\\n820\\t1\\t490\\n822\\t1\\t490\\n828\\t1\\t490\\n834\\t1\\t490\\n860\\t1\\t490\\n870\\t1\\t490\\n879\\t1\\t490\\n925\\t1\\t490\\n957\\t1\\t490\\n976\\t1\\t490\\n986\\t1\\t490\\n1035\\t1\\t490\\n1072\\t1\\t490\\n1091\\t1\\t490\\n1148\\t1\\t490\\n1227\\t1\\t490\\n1283\\t1\\t490\\n1294\\t2\\t490\\n1298\\t1\\t490\\n1299\\t1\\t490\\n1317\\t1\\t490\\n1353\\t1\\t490\\n1359\\t1\\t490\\n1360\\t1\\t490\\n1363\\t1\\t490\\n1366\\t1\\t490\\n1367\\t1\\t490\\n1368\\t1\\t490\\n1396\\t1\\t490\\n1400\\t1\\t490\\n1410\\t1\\t490\\n1424\\t1\\t490\\n1424\\t1\\t490\\n.I 491\\n.T\\nThe Unilever Research SDI System\\n.A\\nRowlands, D.G.\\n.W\\n   The Research SDI System has now been in operation for one year using the ISI\\nSource Tapes as a data base..

Since the user is the only person competent\\nto make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the\\nselection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval\\nerror.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures\\nof performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the\\nsystem to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure\\nto retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It is\\ndifficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in\\nbeing provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user\\'s point of view,\\ntherefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a\\ndeficient system.\\n.X\\n27\\t1\\t492\\n38\\t1\\t492\\n74\\t1\\t492\\n83\\t1\\t492\\n84\\t1\\t492\\n124\\t1\\t492\\n127\\t1\\t492\\n129\\t1\\t492\\n158\\t1\\t492\\n190\\t1\\t492\\n191\\t1\\t492\\n197\\t1\\t492\\n211\\t1\\t492\\n214\\t1\\t492\\n218\\t2\\t492\\n243\\t2\\t492\\n253\\t1\\t492\\n307\\t1\\t492\\n330\\t1\\t492\\n375\\t1\\t492\\n378\\t1\\t492\\n408\\t1\\t492\\n450\\t1\\t492\\n451\\t1\\t492\\n452\\t1\\t492\\n459\\t1\\t492\\n468\\t1\\t492\\n481\\t1\\t492\\n484\\t1\\t492\\n488\\t1\\t492\\n489\\t1\\t492\\n490\\t4\\t492\\n491\\t4\\t492\\n492\\t6\\t492\\n493\\t1\\t492\\n494\\t1\\t492\\n495\\t2\\t492\\n496\\t3\\t492\\n497\\t4\\t492\\n498\\t1\\t492\\n499\\t1\\t492\\n500\\t1\\t492\\n506\\t1\\t492\\n507\\t1\\t492\\n508\\t2\\t492\\n510\\t1\\t492\\n511\\t1\\t492\\n512\\t1\\t492\\n514\\t1\\t492\\n518\\t1\\t492\\n520\\t1\\t492\\n523\\t1\\t492\\n524\\t1\\t492\\n525\\t1\\t492\\n526\\t1\\t492\\n529\\t1\\t492\\n530\\t1\\t492\\n534\\t1\\t492\\n546\\t1\\t492\\n548\\t1\\t492\\n553\\t1\\t492\\n579\\t1\\t492\\n581\\t2\\t492\\n583\\t1\\t492\\n584\\t2\\t492\\n586\\t1\\t492\\n591\\t1\\t492\\n594\\t2\\t492\\n601\\t1\\t492\\n603\\t1\\t492\\n604\\t2\\t492\\n606\\t1\\t492\\n607\\t1\\t492\\n609\\t1\\t492\\n610\\t1\\t492\\n611\\t1\\t492\\n612\\t1\\t492\\n625\\t1\\t492\\n626\\t1\\t492\\n630\\t1\\t492\\n636\\t1\\t492\\n637\\t1\\t492\\n642\\t1\\t492\\n648\\t1\\t492\\n650\\t1\\t492\\n659\\t1\\t492\\n692\\t1\\t492\\n696\\t1\\t492\\n699\\t1\\t492\\n703\\t1\\t492\\n705\\t1\\t492\\n708\\t1\\t492\\n726\\t1\\t492\\n727\\t1\\t492\\n728\\t1\\t492\\n731\\t1\\t492\\n732\\t1\\t492\\n733\\t1\\t492\\n734\\t1\\t492\\n736\\t1\\t492\\n738\\t1\\t492\\n739\\t1\\t492\\n740\\t1\\t492\\n741\\t1\\t492\\n742\\t1\\t492\\n743\\t1\\t492\\n744\\t1\\t492\\n755\\t1\\t492\\n795\\t1\\t492\\n801\\t1\\t492\\n820\\t1\\t492\\n826\\t1\\t492\\n827\\t1\\t492\\n866\\t1\\t492\\n867\\t1\\t492\\n879\\t1\\t492\\n883\\t1\\t492\\n986\\t1\\t492\\n1004\\t1\\t492\\n1035\\t2\\t492\\n1042\\t1\\t492\\n1078\\t1\\t492\\n1087\\t1\\t492\\n1089\\t1\\t492\\n1091\\t1\\t492\\n1207\\t1\\t492\\n1264\\t1\\t492\\n1294\\t2\\t492\\n1297\\t1\\t492\\n1303\\t1\\t492\\n1327\\t1\\t492\\n1356\\t1\\t492\\n1364\\t1\\t492\\n1368\\t1\\t492\\n1370\\t1\\t492\\n1372\\t1\\t492\\n1373\\t1\\t492\\n1374\\t1\\t492\\n1375\\t1\\t492\\n1376\\t1\\t492\\n1377\\t1\\t492\\n1377\\t1\\t492\\n.I 493\\n.T\\nExperimental Use of a Program for Computer-Aided Subject-Index Production\\n.A\\nArmitage, J.E.\\nLynch, M.

With different choice of \\nparameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data \\nbases..\\n   An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to\\nformulation of different search techniques.. It is suggested that the search \\nprocedure should be designed to minimize computation time at the expense of \\nconvenience in the form of output, but that facilities should be included so \\nthat the user who is willing to play the additional cost may receive output in \\na more convenient form..\\n   In recognition of the fact that the form of search question should be \\ndependent on the vocabulary of the data base, a program has been developed to \\nmodify a question so that it is optimal for searches on the given data base..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t495\\n19\\t1\\t495\\n27\\t1\\t495\\n38\\t1\\t495\\n65\\t1\\t495\\n74\\t1\\t495\\n75\\t1\\t495\\n76\\t1\\t495\\n83\\t1\\t495\\n84\\t1\\t495\\n125\\t1\\t495\\n145\\t1\\t495\\n156\\t1\\t495\\n158\\t1\\t495\\n211\\t1\\t495\\n213\\t1\\t495\\n214\\t1\\t495\\n228\\t2\\t495\\n318\\t1\\t495\\n321\\t1\\t495\\n324\\t1\\t495\\n329\\t3\\t495\\n378\\t1\\t495\\n382\\t1\\t495\\n416\\t2\\t495\\n440\\t1\\t495\\n442\\t3\\t495\\n450\\t2\\t495\\n452\\t1\\t495\\n453\\t1\\t495\\n467\\t1\\t495\\n468\\t1\\t495\\n488\\t1\\t495\\n489\\t1\\t495\\n490\\t3\\t495\\n491\\t3\\t495\\n492\\t2\\t495\\n493\\t1\\t495\\n494\\t1\\t495\\n495\\t11\\t495\\n496\\t2\\t495\\n497\\t2\\t495\\n499\\t1\\t495\\n500\\t1\\t495\\n506\\t1\\t495\\n508\\t1\\t495\\n511\\t6\\t495\\n512\\t2\\t495\\n514\\t1\\t495\\n517\\t1\\t495\\n520\\t1\\t495\\n521\\t1\\t495\\n523\\t1\\t495\\n524\\t3\\t495\\n526\\t1\\t495\\n528\\t1\\t495\\n563\\t2\\t495\\n565\\t1\\t495\\n567\\t1\\t495\\n576\\t1\\t495\\n580\\t1\\t495\\n581\\t1\\t495\\n583\\t1\\t495\\n584\\t2\\t495\\n586\\t1\\t495\\n591\\t1\\t495\\n604\\t1\\t495\\n609\\t1\\t495\\n612\\t1\\t495\\n619\\t1\\t495\\n622\\t1\\t495\\n623\\t1\\t495\\n629\\t1\\t495\\n631\\t1\\t495\\n632\\t1\\t495\\n633\\t1\\t495\\n659\\t1\\t495\\n689\\t1\\t495\\n699\\t1\\t495\\n700\\t1\\t495\\n705\\t1\\t495\\n707\\t1\\t495\\n723\\t1\\t495\\n726\\t1\\t495\\n727\\t2\\t495\\n728\\t1\\t495\\n729\\t1\\t495\\n730\\t1\\t495\\n731\\t1\\t495\\n754\\t1\\t495\\n779\\t1\\t495\\n790\\t1\\t495\\n795\\t1\\t495\\n801\\t1\\t495\\n812\\t1\\t495\\n813\\t1\\t495\\n814\\t1\\t495\\n820\\t1\\t495\\n822\\t1\\t495\\n835\\t2\\t495\\n851\\t2\\t495\\n862\\t2\\t495\\n866\\t1\\t495\\n870\\t1\\t495\\n873\\t1\\t495\\n875\\t2\\t495\\n986\\t1\\t495\\n1053\\t1\\t495\\n1055\\t1\\t495\\n1072\\t1\\t495\\n1078\\t1\\t495\\n1083\\t1\\t495\\n1086\\t1\\t495\\n1089\\t1\\t495\\n1091\\t1\\t495\\n1143\\t1\\t495\\n1194\\t2\\t495\\n1199\\t2\\t495\\n1264\\t1\\t495\\n1294\\t1\\t495\\n1295\\t1\\t495\\n1297\\t1\\t495\\n1302\\t1\\t495\\n1303\\t1\\t495\\n1366\\t1\\t495\\n1367\\t1\\t495\\n1368\\t1\\t495\\n1396\\t2\\t495\\n1398\\t1\\t495\\n1398\\t1\\t495\\n.I 496\\n.T\\nThe Cost and Costing of Information Storage and Retrieval \\n.A\\nSessions, V.S.\\n.W\\n  This presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is based\\non data gathered by Project URBANDOC during the course of four years in\\ndeveloping documentation services for the literature of urban planning\\nand renewal.  It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars is\\nno small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban Renewal\\nDemonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\\n(HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated the\\nProject in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic\\nservices in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians\\nwere looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems.\\nURBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of\\nliterature which had been neglected by the information science community before\\nthe advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards.\\n.X\\n27\\t1\\t496\\n38\\t1\\t496\\n74\\t2\\t496\\n83\\t2\\t496\\n84\\t1\\t496\\n158\\t1\\t496\\n166\\t1\\t496\\n245\\t1\\t496\\n273\\t1\\t496\\n279\\t1\\t496\\n288\\t1\\t496\\n331\\t1\\t496\\n381\\t1\\t496\\n408\\t1\\t496\\n488\\t1\\t496\\n489\\t1\\t496\\n490\\t4\\t496\\n491\\t4\\t496\\n492\\t3\\t496\\n493\\t1\\t496\\n494\\t1\\t496\\n495\\t2\\t496\\n496\\t7\\t496\\n497\\t3\\t496\\n498\\t1\\t496\\n499\\t1\\t496\\n500\\t1\\t496\\n581\\t2\\t496\\n582\\t1\\t496\\n583\\t1\\t496\\n584\\t2\\t496\\n586\\t1\\t496\\n591\\t2\\t496\\n592\\t1\\t496\\n657\\t1\\t496\\n659\\t1\\t496\\n690\\t1\\t496\\n723\\t1\\t496\\n724\\t1\\t496\\n795\\t1\\t496\\n801\\t1\\t496\\n815\\t1\\t496\\n834\\t1\\t496\\n860\\t1\\t496\\n925\\t1\\t496\\n957\\t1\\t496\\n976\\t1\\t496\\n986\\t1\\t496\\n1012\\t1\\t496\\n1035\\t1\\t496\\n1148\\t1\\t496\\n1227\\t1\\t496\\n1293\\t1\\t496\\n1294\\t2\\t496\\n1295\\t1\\t496\\n1296\\t1\\t496\\n1317\\t1\\t496\\n1353\\t1\\t496\\n1359\\t1\\t496\\n1360\\t1\\t496\\n1400\\t1\\t496\\n1410\\t1\\t496\\n1424\\t1\\t496\\n1424\\t1\\t496\\n.I 497\\n.T\\nSome Cost Estimates for Bibliographical Searching in a Large-Scale\\nSocial Sciences Information System\\n.A\\nThompson, G.K.\\n.W\\n  Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation today\\ngrew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments\\nto have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological\\ninformation.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the\\nfield of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is\\nacute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two\\nsystems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other\\npolicy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social \\ndevelopment.\\n  An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be\\ndescribed, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical \\noperating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these\\nfigures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,\\nfile maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other\\nthan general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system\\nmay have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted\\ninformation systems may make sense within individual institutional\\nenvironments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking\\nvarious collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate\\nmore efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line\\nnetworks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility\\nof having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.\\n.X\\n27\\t1\\t497\\n38\\t1\\t497\\n74\\t1\\t497\\n83\\t1\\t497\\n84\\t1\\t497\\n158\\t1\\t497\\n172\\t1\\t497\\n218\\t1\\t497\\n243\\t1\\t497\\n253\\t1\\t497\\n375\\t1\\t497\\n408\\t1\\t497\\n482\\t1\\t497\\n488\\t1\\t497\\n489\\t1\\t497\\n490\\t3\\t497\\n491\\t3\\t497\\n492\\t4\\t497\\n493\\t1\\t497\\n494\\t1\\t497\\n495\\t2\\t497\\n496\\t3\\t497\\n497\\t5\\t497\\n498\\t1\\t497\\n499\\t1\\t497\\n500\\t1\\t497\\n506\\t1\\t497\\n507\\t1\\t497\\n508\\t1\\t497\\n510\\t1\\t497\\n548\\t1\\t497\\n581\\t2\\t497\\n583\\t1\\t497\\n584\\t2\\t497\\n586\\t1\\t497\\n591\\t1\\t497\\n594\\t1\\t497\\n601\\t1\\t497\\n604\\t1\\t497\\n607\\t1\\t497\\n659\\t1\\t497\\n795\\t1\\t497\\n801\\t1\\t497\\n866\\t1\\t497\\n867\\t1\\t497\\n986\\t1\\t497\\n1035\\t1\\t497\\n1042\\t1\\t497\\n1087\\t1\\t497\\n1207\\t1\\t497\\n1294\\t2\\t497\\n1327\\t1\\t497\\n1327\\t1\\t497\\n.I 498\\n.T\\nMechanized Searching of Acts of Parliament\\n.A\\nNiblett, G.B.F.\\nPrice, N.H.\\n.W\\n   This paper reports the results of a practical study of the application of \\ndigital computers to the storage, analysis and retrieval of the full text of \\nActs of Parliament and associated delegated legislation dealing with automatic \\nenergy, a total of some 140,000 words..

Although effectiveness-type \\ncriteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the \\nstate-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate \\nfor operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that \\ntakes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of \\noperating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing \\npossible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of \\neffectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, \\nmachine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of \\ncriterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach\\nis described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of \\neffectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to\\nreduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of \\ndefining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete \\nsteps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and \\nsmall-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..\\n.X\\n38\\t1\\t500\\n84\\t1\\t500\\n158\\t1\\t500\\n174\\t1\\t500\\n175\\t1\\t500\\n176\\t1\\t500\\n332\\t1\\t500\\n446\\t2\\t500\\n488\\t1\\t500\\n489\\t2\\t500\\n490\\t1\\t500\\n491\\t1\\t500\\n492\\t1\\t500\\n493\\t2\\t500\\n494\\t1\\t500\\n495\\t1\\t500\\n496\\t1\\t500\\n497\\t1\\t500\\n499\\t3\\t500\\n500\\t5\\t500\\n517\\t2\\t500\\n522\\t1\\t500\\n527\\t2\\t500\\n576\\t1\\t500\\n581\\t1\\t500\\n583\\t1\\t500\\n584\\t1\\t500\\n586\\t1\\t500\\n659\\t1\\t500\\n795\\t1\\t500\\n801\\t1\\t500\\n830\\t1\\t500\\n986\\t1\\t500\\n1294\\t1\\t500\\n1317\\t1\\t500\\n1327\\t1\\t500\\n1400\\t1\\t500\\n1400\\t1\\t500\\n.I 501\\n.T\\nCompilation of Thesauri for Use in Computer Systems\\n.A\\nRolling, L.N.\\n.W\\n  A thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in information\\nstorage and retrieval systems.\\n  Three parts of this definition need further elaboration:\\n  1.

H.\\nHeaps, H. S.\\n.W\\n   Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of \\nspecial techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the \\nnumber of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the \\ncomputer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of \\ninternal memory..\\n   The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that \\nmeets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically \\nexpressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural \\nspelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for\\nextensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted\\nindex greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long\\nstrings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage..\\nCreation of \"reduced\" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it\\nallows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed \\nto use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t511\\n19\\t1\\t511\\n44\\t1\\t511\\n57\\t1\\t511\\n124\\t2\\t511\\n125\\t2\\t511\\n127\\t1\\t511\\n129\\t1\\t511\\n145\\t1\\t511\\n165\\t1\\t511\\n190\\t1\\t511\\n191\\t1\\t511\\n197\\t1\\t511\\n211\\t2\\t511\\n214\\t1\\t511\\n218\\t1\\t511\\n228\\t3\\t511\\n243\\t1\\t511\\n307\\t1\\t511\\n316\\t1\\t511\\n318\\t2\\t511\\n321\\t2\\t511\\n324\\t2\\t511\\n329\\t6\\t511\\n330\\t1\\t511\\n359\\t1\\t511\\n378\\t2\\t511\\n381\\t1\\t511\\n416\\t5\\t511\\n440\\t1\\t511\\n442\\t6\\t511\\n448\\t1\\t511\\n450\\t6\\t511\\n451\\t1\\t511\\n452\\t3\\t511\\n453\\t1\\t511\\n459\\t1\\t511\\n467\\t1\\t511\\n468\\t2\\t511\\n484\\t2\\t511\\n492\\t1\\t511\\n495\\t6\\t511\\n506\\t1\\t511\\n508\\t2\\t511\\n511\\t13\\t511\\n512\\t2\\t511\\n514\\t2\\t511\\n516\\t1\\t511\\n517\\t1\\t511\\n518\\t2\\t511\\n520\\t2\\t511\\n521\\t3\\t511\\n522\\t1\\t511\\n523\\t3\\t511\\n524\\t5\\t511\\n525\\t1\\t511\\n526\\t3\\t511\\n527\\t1\\t511\\n528\\t2\\t511\\n529\\t2\\t511\\n530\\t1\\t511\\n534\\t1\\t511\\n546\\t1\\t511\\n553\\t1\\t511\\n563\\t1\\t511\\n565\\t3\\t511\\n567\\t3\\t511\\n575\\t1\\t511\\n576\\t1\\t511\\n579\\t1\\t511\\n580\\t1\\t511\\n594\\t1\\t511\\n603\\t1\\t511\\n604\\t2\\t511\\n606\\t1\\t511\\n609\\t2\\t511\\n610\\t2\\t511\\n611\\t1\\t511\\n612\\t2\\t511\\n615\\t1\\t511\\n619\\t1\\t511\\n622\\t1\\t511\\n623\\t1\\t511\\n625\\t2\\t511\\n626\\t2\\t511\\n629\\t1\\t511\\n630\\t1\\t511\\n631\\t1\\t511\\n632\\t1\\t511\\n633\\t1\\t511\\n636\\t2\\t511\\n637\\t1\\t511\\n642\\t1\\t511\\n648\\t1\\t511\\n650\\t1\\t511\\n692\\t1\\t511\\n696\\t1\\t511\\n699\\t2\\t511\\n700\\t3\\t511\\n703\\t1\\t511\\n705\\t3\\t511\\n707\\t2\\t511\\n708\\t1\\t511\\n723\\t1\\t511\\n726\\t2\\t511\\n727\\t3\\t511\\n728\\t2\\t511\\n729\\t1\\t511\\n730\\t1\\t511\\n731\\t2\\t511\\n732\\t1\\t511\\n733\\t1\\t511\\n734\\t1\\t511\\n736\\t1\\t511\\n738\\t1\\t511\\n739\\t1\\t511\\n740\\t1\\t511\\n741\\t1\\t511\\n742\\t1\\t511\\n743\\t1\\t511\\n744\\t1\\t511\\n754\\t2\\t511\\n755\\t1\\t511\\n791\\t2\\t511\\n812\\t2\\t511\\n813\\t1\\t511\\n814\\t1\\t511\\n817\\t1\\t511\\n820\\t2\\t511\\n822\\t1\\t511\\n824\\t1\\t511\\n826\\t1\\t511\\n827\\t1\\t511\\n835\\t2\\t511\\n851\\t2\\t511\\n856\\t1\\t511\\n862\\t2\\t511\\n866\\t1\\t511\\n867\\t1\\t511\\n870\\t1\\t511\\n872\\t1\\t511\\n873\\t1\\t511\\n875\\t4\\t511\\n879\\t1\\t511\\n883\\t1\\t511\\n894\\t1\\t511\\n1004\\t1\\t511\\n1035\\t1\\t511\\n1078\\t2\\t511\\n1089\\t2\\t511\\n1091\\t2\\t511\\n1143\\t1\\t511\\n1194\\t3\\t511\\n1196\\t1\\t511\\n1199\\t3\\t511\\n1207\\t1\\t511\\n1264\\t2\\t511\\n1297\\t1\\t511\\n1302\\t1\\t511\\n1303\\t3\\t511\\n1327\\t1\\t511\\n1356\\t1\\t511\\n1362\\t1\\t511\\n1364\\t2\\t511\\n1366\\t2\\t511\\n1367\\t2\\t511\\n1368\\t3\\t511\\n1370\\t1\\t511\\n1372\\t1\\t511\\n1373\\t1\\t511\\n1374\\t1\\t511\\n1375\\t1\\t511\\n1376\\t1\\t511\\n1377\\t1\\t511\\n1396\\t2\\t511\\n1398\\t1\\t511\\n1398\\t1\\t511\\n.I 512\\n.T\\nExperiences of IIT Research Institute in Operating a Computerized Retrieval\\nSystem for Searching a Variety of Data Bases\\n.A\\nWilliams, Martha E.\\n.W\\n   The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) provides\\ninformation from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, government\\nand universities..

The system, which permits the \\nfree text searching of approximately 8000 abstracts drawn from Epilepsy \\nAbstracts, is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and \\nStroke (NINDS).. Specialists in the field of neurology, at six medical centers\\nin the United States, conducted on-line searches to satisfy their own needs for \\ninformation.. Parallel searches were conducted on the same search topics by a \\nneurologist at NINDS who was highly experienced in using the system.. The \\nresults of the original searches were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, \\nand general user satisfaction..

The model incorporates an objective function based on \\nexpected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which \\naccount for the scarcity of capital.. The model can be used to aid the \\nlibrarian in making better selection decisions, since the objective function \\ncan be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information \\nretrieval system and as a service organization.. Moreover, the model of seen to \\nbe related to inventory problems and scheduling models in industrial \\noperations.. \\n   Journal usage is discussed as a measure of journal worth and is contrasted \\nto journal productivity..

A.\\n.W\\n   In a structured data base, such as that obtained when information is indexed\\nin a format including explicit relations, retrieval of all relevant items in\\nresponse to a question may, in some cases, be restricted by technicalities of \\nthe structure.. Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of \\na concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two \\ninterstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in \\norder to overcome one of these technicalities..

The automation of DDC\\'s indexing has been \\nmachine-aided from its inception.. A machine-aided indexing (MAI) system is \\ndescribed that indexes one million words of text per hour of CPU time.. \\nGrammatical errors do not exceed five per cent of the output, so human \\nscreening is satisfactorily low.. The system could potentially scale up to an\\noperational size of 10 million words of text per year - the equivalent of a\\ndozen bibles or a third of the Encyclopedia Britannica..

H.\\n.W\\n   A general measure of retrieval effectiveness having full metric properties \\nand treating the \"retrieval system - arbiter of relevance\"situation \\nsymmetrically, is the Marczewski-Steinhaus metric, D, measuring the distance \\nbetween the set of relevant documents, A, and set of retrieved documents, B, \\naccording to D = 1 -(n (A ^ B)/n(A u B)).. D can be expressed as a function of \\nPresicion and Recall, or of Generality, Fallout and Recall, and of other sets \\nof traditional measures.. Acceptance of the measure allows criteria for \\nretrieval optimality and degeneracy to be stated, defined by minimum and \\nconstant  values of D respectively.. Precision_Recall degeneracy curves for D \\nare given and compared with those for another general measure: the probability\\nthat a document will be correctly identified by a retrieval system.. \\nStatistical extensions of D are examined, and these and other properties of the\\nmetric are illustrated with seven examples..\\n.X\\n54\\t1\\t519\\n73\\t3\\t519\\n175\\t1\\t519\\n319\\t1\\t519\\n390\\t1\\t519\\n509\\t3\\t519\\n519\\t5\\t519\\n565\\t1\\t519\\n587\\t1\\t519\\n625\\t1\\t519\\n649\\t1\\t519\\n660\\t1\\t519\\n764\\t1\\t519\\n780\\t3\\t519\\n785\\t1\\t519\\n810\\t1\\t519\\n824\\t1\\t519\\n829\\t2\\t519\\n895\\t2\\t519\\n1091\\t1\\t519\\n1307\\t3\\t519\\n1427\\t1\\t519\\n1427\\t1\\t519\\n.I 520\\n.T\\nCA Condensates as a Retrospective Search Tool\\tA Commentary\\n.A\\nHansen, Inge Berg\\n.W\\n   A retrospective test search on 1 year of CA Condensates was carried out in \\norder to calculate the cost per profile and to get an impression of how CA \\nCondensates would suffice as a database for a retrospective use.. Some means of\\nimproving the search strategy by means of the CAS Standard Distribution Format\\nwere investigated.. The question is raised whether the costs and efforts \\npresently devoted to research regarding retrospective searches on large \\nfree-text databases are justified in view of the low average precision ratios \\ngenerally observed for free text databases and the very high number of \\nreferences of potential interest retrieved..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t520\\n38\\t1\\t520\\n51\\t1\\t520\\n69\\t1\\t520\\n71\\t1\\t520\\n77\\t1\\t520\\n79\\t1\\t520\\n86\\t1\\t520\\n124\\t1\\t520\\n125\\t1\\t520\\n127\\t1\\t520\\n129\\t1\\t520\\n145\\t1\\t520\\n164\\t1\\t520\\n168\\t1\\t520\\n172\\t1\\t520\\n175\\t2\\t520\\n176\\t1\\t520\\n178\\t1\\t520\\n190\\t1\\t520\\n191\\t1\\t520\\n197\\t1\\t520\\n211\\t2\\t520\\n214\\t1\\t520\\n218\\t1\\t520\\n243\\t1\\t520\\n307\\t1\\t520\\n315\\t1\\t520\\n330\\t1\\t520\\n374\\t1\\t520\\n378\\t2\\t520\\n382\\t2\\t520\\n389\\t1\\t520\\n390\\t1\\t520\\n419\\t1\\t520\\n440\\t1\\t520\\n448\\t1\\t520\\n450\\t1\\t520\\n451\\t1\\t520\\n452\\t2\\t520\\n453\\t1\\t520\\n459\\t1\\t520\\n467\\t1\\t520\\n468\\t2\\t520\\n480\\t1\\t520\\n481\\t1\\t520\\n483\\t1\\t520\\n484\\t2\\t520\\n486\\t1\\t520\\n488\\t1\\t520\\n491\\t2\\t520\\n492\\t1\\t520\\n493\\t1\\t520\\n495\\t1\\t520\\n503\\t1\\t520\\n506\\t1\\t520\\n507\\t2\\t520\\n508\\t2\\t520\\n509\\t1\\t520\\n510\\t2\\t520\\n511\\t2\\t520\\n512\\t3\\t520\\n514\\t4\\t520\\n517\\t2\\t520\\n518\\t1\\t520\\n520\\t7\\t520\\n521\\t1\\t520\\n522\\t1\\t520\\n523\\t3\\t520\\n524\\t2\\t520\\n525\\t1\\t520\\n526\\t2\\t520\\n527\\t1\\t520\\n528\\t2\\t520\\n529\\t1\\t520\\n530\\t1\\t520\\n531\\t1\\t520\\n534\\t1\\t520\\n546\\t1\\t520\\n553\\t1\\t520\\n565\\t1\\t520\\n566\\t1\\t520\\n570\\t1\\t520\\n576\\t2\\t520\\n579\\t1\\t520\\n580\\t1\\t520\\n581\\t1\\t520\\n582\\t1\\t520\\n586\\t1\\t520\\n594\\t1\\t520\\n596\\t1\\t520\\n603\\t3\\t520\\n604\\t2\\t520\\n606\\t1\\t520\\n608\\t2\\t520\\n609\\t2\\t520\\n610\\t1\\t520\\n611\\t1\\t520\\n612\\t3\\t520\\n619\\t1\\t520\\n622\\t1\\t520\\n623\\t2\\t520\\n625\\t1\\t520\\n626\\t1\\t520\\n629\\t1\\t520\\n630\\t1\\t520\\n631\\t1\\t520\\n632\\t1\\t520\\n633\\t2\\t520\\n636\\t2\\t520\\n637\\t1\\t520\\n642\\t1\\t520\\n643\\t1\\t520\\n648\\t1\\t520\\n650\\t1\\t520\\n659\\t2\\t520\\n692\\t1\\t520\\n696\\t1\\t520\\n699\\t2\\t520\\n700\\t1\\t520\\n703\\t1\\t520\\n705\\t2\\t520\\n707\\t1\\t520\\n708\\t1\\t520\\n715\\t1\\t520\\n723\\t1\\t520\\n726\\t3\\t520\\n727\\t2\\t520\\n728\\t2\\t520\\n729\\t1\\t520\\n730\\t1\\t520\\n731\\t2\\t520\\n732\\t1\\t520\\n733\\t1\\t520\\n734\\t1\\t520\\n736\\t1\\t520\\n738\\t1\\t520\\n739\\t1\\t520\\n740\\t1\\t520\\n741\\t1\\t520\\n742\\t1\\t520\\n743\\t1\\t520\\n744\\t1\\t520\\n754\\t2\\t520\\n755\\t2\\t520\\n790\\t1\\t520\\n805\\t1\\t520\\n809\\t1\\t520\\n810\\t1\\t520\\n812\\t2\\t520\\n813\\t3\\t520\\n814\\t2\\t520\\n817\\t1\\t520\\n820\\t4\\t520\\n822\\t3\\t520\\n824\\t1\\t520\\n825\\t1\\t520\\n826\\t1\\t520\\n827\\t2\\t520\\n866\\t1\\t520\\n870\\t1\\t520\\n873\\t1\\t520\\n879\\t1\\t520\\n883\\t1\\t520\\n894\\t2\\t520\\n907\\t1\\t520\\n1004\\t1\\t520\\n1035\\t1\\t520\\n1051\\t1\\t520\\n1078\\t2\\t520\\n1089\\t2\\t520\\n1091\\t3\\t520\\n1143\\t1\\t520\\n1207\\t1\\t520\\n1264\\t2\\t520\\n1294\\t1\\t520\\n1297\\t1\\t520\\n1302\\t1\\t520\\n1303\\t2\\t520\\n1313\\t1\\t520\\n1327\\t2\\t520\\n1356\\t1\\t520\\n1364\\t1\\t520\\n1366\\t1\\t520\\n1367\\t1\\t520\\n1368\\t2\\t520\\n1370\\t2\\t520\\n1372\\t1\\t520\\n1373\\t1\\t520\\n1374\\t1\\t520\\n1375\\t1\\t520\\n1376\\t1\\t520\\n1377\\t1\\t520\\n1396\\t1\\t520\\n1419\\t2\\t520\\n1427\\t1\\t520\\n1448\\t1\\t520\\n1448\\t1\\t520\\n.I 521\\n.T\\nCompression of Bibliographic Files Using an Adaptation of Run-Length Coding\\n.A\\nLynch, Michael F.\\n.W\\n   Substantial degrees of compression of bibliographical data bases result from\\nthe application to them a modified form of run-length coding..

G.\\n.W\\n   A system of automatic indexing based on Baye\\'s theorem is described \\nbriefly.. In assigning 124 documents to 9 categories, there were 97 cases of \\nagreement with professional indexers.. Using a collection factor, based on 87 \\nper cent human consistency from other courses, the computer appears then to \\nindex with 90 per cent accuracy in this case..\\n   The technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawn\\nfrom nine categories.. Each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing the\\nother.. The computer knows only the number of categories.. After 8 cycles the \\ncomputer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of \\ndocuments that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis \\nof subject content..\\n   A new measure of performance is proposed and some other applications of the \\ntechnique indicated..\\n.X\\n51\\t1\\t522\\n69\\t1\\t522\\n71\\t1\\t522\\n77\\t1\\t522\\n79\\t1\\t522\\n124\\t1\\t522\\n125\\t1\\t522\\n141\\t1\\t522\\n165\\t1\\t522\\n168\\t1\\t522\\n175\\t2\\t522\\n176\\t2\\t522\\n299\\t1\\t522\\n315\\t1\\t522\\n333\\t1\\t522\\n381\\t1\\t522\\n382\\t1\\t522\\n446\\t1\\t522\\n448\\t2\\t522\\n452\\t1\\t522\\n480\\t1\\t522\\n483\\t1\\t522\\n484\\t2\\t522\\n486\\t1\\t522\\n488\\t1\\t522\\n491\\t1\\t522\\n493\\t1\\t522\\n499\\t1\\t522\\n500\\t1\\t522\\n503\\t1\\t522\\n507\\t1\\t522\\n509\\t1\\t522\\n510\\t1\\t522\\n511\\t1\\t522\\n512\\t1\\t522\\n516\\t1\\t522\\n517\\t2\\t522\\n518\\t1\\t522\\n520\\t1\\t522\\n521\\t1\\t522\\n522\\t5\\t522\\n523\\t1\\t522\\n526\\t1\\t522\\n527\\t3\\t522\\n528\\t2\\t522\\n529\\t1\\t522\\n530\\t1\\t522\\n531\\t1\\t522\\n565\\t1\\t522\\n566\\t1\\t522\\n575\\t1\\t522\\n576\\t1\\t522\\n581\\t1\\t522\\n596\\t1\\t522\\n603\\t1\\t522\\n608\\t1\\t522\\n610\\t1\\t522\\n615\\t1\\t522\\n625\\t1\\t522\\n626\\t1\\t522\\n627\\t1\\t522\\n628\\t1\\t522\\n633\\t1\\t522\\n636\\t1\\t522\\n659\\t1\\t522\\n700\\t1\\t522\\n705\\t1\\t522\\n707\\t1\\t522\\n715\\t1\\t522\\n727\\t1\\t522\\n754\\t2\\t522\\n790\\t1\\t522\\n805\\t1\\t522\\n809\\t1\\t522\\n810\\t1\\t522\\n812\\t2\\t522\\n813\\t1\\t522\\n814\\t1\\t522\\n817\\t2\\t522\\n824\\t2\\t522\\n825\\t1\\t522\\n830\\t1\\t522\\n873\\t1\\t522\\n874\\t1\\t522\\n875\\t2\\t522\\n876\\t1\\t522\\n892\\t1\\t522\\n894\\t1\\t522\\n941\\t1\\t522\\n994\\t1\\t522\\n995\\t1\\t522\\n996\\t1\\t522\\n997\\t1\\t522\\n998\\t1\\t522\\n1051\\t1\\t522\\n1079\\t1\\t522\\n1153\\t1\\t522\\n1189\\t1\\t522\\n1251\\t1\\t522\\n1294\\t1\\t522\\n1303\\t1\\t522\\n1327\\t2\\t522\\n1351\\t1\\t522\\n1364\\t1\\t522\\n1366\\t1\\t522\\n1367\\t1\\t522\\n1368\\t1\\t522\\n1396\\t1\\t522\\n1419\\t1\\t522\\n1420\\t1\\t522\\n1427\\t1\\t522\\n1434\\t1\\t522\\n1435\\t1\\t522\\n1442\\t1\\t522\\n1442\\t1\\t522\\n.I 523\\n.T\\nThe Cost_Performance of an On-Line, Free-Text Bibliographic Retrieval System\\n.A\\nKatzer, Jeffrey\\n.W\\n   The cost-performance evaluation of the SUPARS system is reported.. SUPARS \\nwas an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectiveness \\ndata of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, two \\nmeasures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in \\ndollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be \\nexpended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an \\nestimate of the recall ratio..\\n   To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which \\nexperts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries\\nfrom written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the \\nlist of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information\\nproblems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each \\nof the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted \\nbelow..\\n   (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have\\nbetter cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant \\nsearching operators..\\n   (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to\\nimproving the cost-performance of the system..\\n   (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among\\nusers of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation \\nand evaluation of retrieval systems..

If he delegates his literature search he should always \\nbe aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. This\\nprevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search,\\nparticularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious\\nof the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot \\ndispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He\\nwill also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed\\nfor operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the \\nmethods sufficient for his personal file..\\n   The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, \\noperating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival \\npower, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of\\nfundamental notions such as \"information\" and \"order\".. This gives him a better\\nunderstanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently,\\neven if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in \\nstorage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to \\nmake such operations more \"objective\" and formal.. Such a better mutual\\nunderstanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of \\nscientific communication..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t525\\n117\\t1\\t525\\n124\\t1\\t525\\n126\\t1\\t525\\n127\\t2\\t525\\n129\\t1\\t525\\n145\\t1\\t525\\n165\\t2\\t525\\n190\\t1\\t525\\n191\\t1\\t525\\n197\\t1\\t525\\n211\\t1\\t525\\n214\\t1\\t525\\n218\\t1\\t525\\n243\\t1\\t525\\n307\\t1\\t525\\n330\\t1\\t525\\n357\\t1\\t525\\n376\\t1\\t525\\n378\\t1\\t525\\n445\\t1\\t525\\n449\\t1\\t525\\n450\\t1\\t525\\n451\\t1\\t525\\n452\\t1\\t525\\n459\\t2\\t525\\n468\\t1\\t525\\n476\\t1\\t525\\n484\\t1\\t525\\n492\\t1\\t525\\n508\\t1\\t525\\n511\\t1\\t525\\n512\\t1\\t525\\n514\\t1\\t525\\n518\\t1\\t525\\n520\\t1\\t525\\n523\\t1\\t525\\n524\\t2\\t525\\n525\\t5\\t525\\n526\\t2\\t525\\n527\\t1\\t525\\n529\\t2\\t525\\n530\\t2\\t525\\n533\\t1\\t525\\n534\\t2\\t525\\n546\\t1\\t525\\n553\\t1\\t525\\n574\\t1\\t525\\n579\\t1\\t525\\n590\\t1\\t525\\n594\\t1\\t525\\n603\\t1\\t525\\n604\\t1\\t525\\n606\\t1\\t525\\n609\\t1\\t525\\n610\\t1\\t525\\n611\\t1\\t525\\n612\\t1\\t525\\n616\\t1\\t525\\n621\\t2\\t525\\n625\\t1\\t525\\n626\\t1\\t525\\n630\\t1\\t525\\n633\\t1\\t525\\n635\\t1\\t525\\n636\\t2\\t525\\n637\\t2\\t525\\n640\\t1\\t525\\n641\\t1\\t525\\n642\\t2\\t525\\n648\\t1\\t525\\n650\\t1\\t525\\n668\\t1\\t525\\n670\\t1\\t525\\n671\\t1\\t525\\n674\\t1\\t525\\n683\\t1\\t525\\n689\\t1\\t525\\n692\\t1\\t525\\n696\\t1\\t525\\n699\\t1\\t525\\n702\\t1\\t525\\n703\\t2\\t525\\n705\\t1\\t525\\n708\\t1\\t525\\n715\\t1\\t525\\n726\\t1\\t525\\n727\\t1\\t525\\n728\\t1\\t525\\n730\\t1\\t525\\n731\\t1\\t525\\n732\\t2\\t525\\n733\\t2\\t525\\n734\\t2\\t525\\n736\\t2\\t525\\n738\\t1\\t525\\n739\\t1\\t525\\n740\\t1\\t525\\n741\\t1\\t525\\n742\\t1\\t525\\n743\\t1\\t525\\n744\\t1\\t525\\n755\\t1\\t525\\n797\\t1\\t525\\n819\\t1\\t525\\n820\\t1\\t525\\n823\\t1\\t525\\n826\\t2\\t525\\n827\\t2\\t525\\n877\\t1\\t525\\n879\\t2\\t525\\n883\\t1\\t525\\n1004\\t1\\t525\\n1035\\t1\\t525\\n1077\\t2\\t525\\n1078\\t1\\t525\\n1089\\t1\\t525\\n1091\\t1\\t525\\n1207\\t1\\t525\\n1231\\t2\\t525\\n1264\\t1\\t525\\n1297\\t1\\t525\\n1303\\t1\\t525\\n1305\\t1\\t525\\n1306\\t1\\t525\\n1313\\t1\\t525\\n1356\\t1\\t525\\n1364\\t1\\t525\\n1368\\t1\\t525\\n1370\\t2\\t525\\n1372\\t2\\t525\\n1373\\t1\\t525\\n1374\\t1\\t525\\n1375\\t1\\t525\\n1376\\t1\\t525\\n1377\\t1\\t525\\n1383\\t1\\t525\\n1396\\t1\\t525\\n1396\\t1\\t525\\n.I 526\\n.T\\nOn-Line Information retrieval as a Scientists Tool\\n.A\\nBarber, Stephanie A.\\nBarraclough, Elizabeth D.\\nGray, W.

With the availability of many\\ncomputer-readable bibliographic data bases, experience with users dictated the \\ndevelopment of special-purpose information products based on a thorough \\nunderstanding of individual client needs, and the delivery of such products in \\na customized form.. Each different application required a different package, \\nwith variations of both software and data base coverage..

A.\\n.W\\n   A proposal for a computer-aided method of building up an indexing language \\nis made.. The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special \\nretrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference\\nCode when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be \\nestablished in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are \\naccomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be \\nbuilt up by a form of \"learning process\" in the course of regular indexing.. \\nThe proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the\\nassociated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language\\nbuilt-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search, \\nusing the thesaurus-classification as a \"switching language\", and for automatic\\nclassification, are suggested as long-term aims..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t530\\n124\\t1\\t530\\n127\\t2\\t530\\n129\\t1\\t530\\n141\\t1\\t530\\n145\\t1\\t530\\n165\\t1\\t530\\n190\\t1\\t530\\n191\\t1\\t530\\n197\\t1\\t530\\n211\\t1\\t530\\n214\\t1\\t530\\n218\\t1\\t530\\n243\\t1\\t530\\n299\\t1\\t530\\n307\\t1\\t530\\n330\\t1\\t530\\n333\\t2\\t530\\n357\\t1\\t530\\n376\\t1\\t530\\n378\\t1\\t530\\n449\\t1\\t530\\n450\\t1\\t530\\n451\\t1\\t530\\n452\\t1\\t530\\n459\\t2\\t530\\n468\\t1\\t530\\n484\\t1\\t530\\n492\\t1\\t530\\n508\\t1\\t530\\n511\\t1\\t530\\n512\\t1\\t530\\n514\\t1\\t530\\n518\\t1\\t530\\n520\\t1\\t530\\n522\\t1\\t530\\n523\\t1\\t530\\n524\\t2\\t530\\n525\\t2\\t530\\n526\\t1\\t530\\n527\\t1\\t530\\n529\\t2\\t530\\n530\\t6\\t530\\n534\\t2\\t530\\n546\\t1\\t530\\n553\\t2\\t530\\n579\\t1\\t530\\n594\\t1\\t530\\n603\\t1\\t530\\n604\\t1\\t530\\n606\\t1\\t530\\n609\\t1\\t530\\n610\\t1\\t530\\n611\\t1\\t530\\n612\\t1\\t530\\n621\\t1\\t530\\n625\\t1\\t530\\n626\\t1\\t530\\n627\\t1\\t530\\n628\\t2\\t530\\n630\\t1\\t530\\n633\\t1\\t530\\n635\\t1\\t530\\n636\\t2\\t530\\n637\\t2\\t530\\n641\\t1\\t530\\n642\\t2\\t530\\n648\\t1\\t530\\n650\\t1\\t530\\n692\\t1\\t530\\n696\\t1\\t530\\n699\\t1\\t530\\n702\\t1\\t530\\n703\\t2\\t530\\n705\\t1\\t530\\n708\\t1\\t530\\n726\\t1\\t530\\n727\\t1\\t530\\n728\\t1\\t530\\n730\\t1\\t530\\n731\\t1\\t530\\n732\\t2\\t530\\n733\\t2\\t530\\n734\\t2\\t530\\n736\\t2\\t530\\n738\\t1\\t530\\n739\\t1\\t530\\n740\\t1\\t530\\n741\\t1\\t530\\n742\\t1\\t530\\n743\\t1\\t530\\n744\\t1\\t530\\n755\\t1\\t530\\n802\\t1\\t530\\n819\\t1\\t530\\n820\\t1\\t530\\n824\\t1\\t530\\n825\\t1\\t530\\n826\\t2\\t530\\n827\\t2\\t530\\n873\\t1\\t530\\n874\\t2\\t530\\n875\\t1\\t530\\n876\\t1\\t530\\n877\\t2\\t530\\n878\\t1\\t530\\n879\\t2\\t530\\n880\\t1\\t530\\n883\\t1\\t530\\n892\\t1\\t530\\n898\\t1\\t530\\n940\\t1\\t530\\n941\\t2\\t530\\n992\\t1\\t530\\n993\\t1\\t530\\n994\\t1\\t530\\n995\\t2\\t530\\n996\\t1\\t530\\n997\\t1\\t530\\n998\\t1\\t530\\n1004\\t1\\t530\\n1035\\t1\\t530\\n1061\\t1\\t530\\n1078\\t1\\t530\\n1079\\t2\\t530\\n1089\\t1\\t530\\n1091\\t1\\t530\\n1146\\t1\\t530\\n1153\\t1\\t530\\n1189\\t1\\t530\\n1207\\t1\\t530\\n1215\\t1\\t530\\n1216\\t1\\t530\\n1231\\t1\\t530\\n1251\\t1\\t530\\n1264\\t1\\t530\\n1297\\t1\\t530\\n1303\\t1\\t530\\n1351\\t1\\t530\\n1356\\t1\\t530\\n1364\\t1\\t530\\n1368\\t1\\t530\\n1370\\t2\\t530\\n1372\\t2\\t530\\n1373\\t1\\t530\\n1374\\t1\\t530\\n1375\\t1\\t530\\n1376\\t1\\t530\\n1377\\t1\\t530\\n1383\\t1\\t530\\n1396\\t2\\t530\\n1420\\t1\\t530\\n1421\\t1\\t530\\n1434\\t2\\t530\\n1435\\t2\\t530\\n1436\\t1\\t530\\n1441\\t1\\t530\\n1442\\t1\\t530\\n1442\\t1\\t530\\n.I 531\\n.T\\nIndex Term Weighting\\n.A\\nJones, Karen Sparck\\n.W\\n   Various approaches to index term weighting have been investigated..

It is\\nassumed that the reader has some understanding of freshman calculus and\\nelementary probability, and in the later chapters some introductory random\\nprocess theory.  Unfortunately there is one more requirement that is harder\\nto meet.  The reader must have a reasonable level of mathematical maturity\\nand capability for abstract thought.

It is\\nfrom these predicates that the characteristics of the\\ncorresponding concepts can be derived.

How are\\nscientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the\\ncirculation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social\\norganization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?\\n   Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the\\nscientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the \\ninformation which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the\\nrelationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the\\nmost part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been\\nconducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as\\nhas been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey\\nand Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of\\ntheory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the \\nstudies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one\\nof these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from\\nall three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will \\ndescribe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t544\\n89\\t2\\t544\\n95\\t2\\t544\\n98\\t1\\t544\\n100\\t1\\t544\\n101\\t1\\t544\\n102\\t1\\t544\\n105\\t4\\t544\\n107\\t1\\t544\\n109\\t1\\t544\\n110\\t1\\t544\\n113\\t1\\t544\\n155\\t1\\t544\\n157\\t1\\t544\\n312\\t1\\t544\\n314\\t1\\t544\\n356\\t2\\t544\\n386\\t2\\t544\\n398\\t1\\t544\\n544\\t5\\t544\\n560\\t3\\t544\\n582\\t1\\t544\\n605\\t1\\t544\\n656\\t1\\t544\\n667\\t1\\t544\\n685\\t1\\t544\\n750\\t1\\t544\\n775\\t1\\t544\\n800\\t1\\t544\\n1030\\t1\\t544\\n1050\\t1\\t544\\n1062\\t1\\t544\\n1063\\t2\\t544\\n1081\\t1\\t544\\n1082\\t1\\t544\\n1088\\t1\\t544\\n1256\\t1\\t544\\n1284\\t2\\t544\\n1285\\t2\\t544\\n1286\\t1\\t544\\n1287\\t1\\t544\\n1290\\t1\\t544\\n1291\\t2\\t544\\n1293\\t1\\t544\\n1294\\t1\\t544\\n1295\\t1\\t544\\n1296\\t1\\t544\\n1297\\t1\\t544\\n1300\\t3\\t544\\n1308\\t1\\t544\\n1312\\t2\\t544\\n1313\\t1\\t544\\n1319\\t1\\t544\\n1334\\t1\\t544\\n1345\\t1\\t544\\n1346\\t2\\t544\\n1386\\t3\\t544\\n1408\\t1\\t544\\n1408\\t1\\t544\\n.I 545\\n.T\\nThe Literature of the Social Sciences: a Survey of Citation Studies\\n.A\\nBroadus, Robert N.\\n.W\\n   The great concern with scientific communication in the last few decades has \\nproduced a number of studies analyzing the use of information..

But the library is also concerned with man as a \\nrational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  The\\ntraditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down\\nand in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in\\nboth its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social\\nand physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the \\nlibrary\\'s humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the\\ntechnology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose\\nsight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit\\nin them.\\n.X\\n555\\t6\\t555\\n555\\t6\\t555\\n.I 556\\n.T\\nIntroduction to Subject Indexing; a Programmed Text\\n.A\\nBrown, A.G.\\n.W\\n  This programmed text has been developed from work initially carried out\\nunder a research project funded by the Office for Scientific and Technical\\nInformation (now the British Library Research and Development\\nDepartment).

They represent a massive investment\\non the part of the government, and consequently are expected to\\nyield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower.\\nOver the last twenty years government expenditure in this country\\non universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more\\nthan two hundred million pounds a year.

The sequential \\ndecision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the\\nresearch expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable\\ninvestment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does \\nnot presuppose continuation of the project into future periods..\\n   The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into \\naccount the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of\\ndynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets\\nwhen the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or\\nunconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the \\npatterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice..\\n   Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit\\ntheir practical application are discussed..\\n.X\\n349\\t1\\t561\\n423\\t6\\t561\\n424\\t5\\t561\\n425\\t5\\t561\\n426\\t1\\t561\\n427\\t1\\t561\\n428\\t2\\t561\\n436\\t1\\t561\\n437\\t1\\t561\\n561\\t9\\t561\\n1036\\t1\\t561\\n1039\\t2\\t561\\n1040\\t2\\t561\\n1449\\t1\\t561\\n1449\\t1\\t561\\n.I 562\\n.T\\nThe Association Factor in Information Retrieval\\n.A\\nStiles, H. Edmund\\n.W\\n   This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find\\ndocuments related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact\\nterms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of their\\nrelevance to the request.. The key to this ability lies in the application of a\\nstatistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association \\nbetween pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations \\n(entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other\\nwords closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a\\nvocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more\\npowerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available\\nheretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list \\nof request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard \\nfor their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and \\narranged in the order of their relevance to the request..\\n.X\\n26\\t3\\t562\\n45\\t1\\t562\\n78\\t1\\t562\\n174\\t1\\t562\\n175\\t2\\t562\\n179\\t1\\t562\\n315\\t1\\t562\\n321\\t1\\t562\\n363\\t1\\t562\\n419\\t3\\t562\\n420\\t1\\t562\\n421\\t1\\t562\\n422\\t1\\t562\\n458\\t1\\t562\\n479\\t1\\t562\\n485\\t1\\t562\\n562\\t7\\t562\\n564\\t3\\t562\\n566\\t2\\t562\\n570\\t1\\t562\\n659\\t1\\t562\\n660\\t3\\t562\\n661\\t1\\t562\\n662\\t2\\t562\\n663\\t2\\t562\\n664\\t3\\t562\\n769\\t1\\t562\\n785\\t1\\t562\\n1044\\t1\\t562\\n1087\\t1\\t562\\n1144\\t1\\t562\\n1154\\t1\\t562\\n1218\\t2\\t562\\n1279\\t1\\t562\\n1327\\t1\\t562\\n1327\\t1\\t562\\n.I 563\\n.T\\nA Study of Methods for Systematically Abbreviating English Words and Names\\n.A\\nBourne, Charles P.\\n.A\\nFord, Donald F.\\n.W\\n   This study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating \\nEnglish words and names.. Most of the attention was given to the techniques \\nwhich could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose \\ndigital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process \\nincoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no table\\nlookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described..\\nIn addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand\\nsubject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a \\nquantitative measure of comparison..\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t563\\n228\\t1\\t563\\n318\\t1\\t563\\n321\\t1\\t563\\n324\\t1\\t563\\n329\\t1\\t563\\n331\\t1\\t563\\n416\\t1\\t563\\n442\\t1\\t563\\n450\\t1\\t563\\n495\\t2\\t563\\n511\\t1\\t563\\n524\\t1\\t563\\n563\\t6\\t563\\n565\\t1\\t563\\n567\\t1\\t563\\n703\\t1\\t563\\n739\\t1\\t563\\n835\\t4\\t563\\n851\\t4\\t563\\n862\\t2\\t563\\n875\\t1\\t563\\n1053\\t1\\t563\\n1194\\t1\\t563\\n1199\\t1\\t563\\n1199\\t1\\t563\\n.I 564\\n.T\\nAutomatic Document Classification\\n.A\\nBorko, Harold\\n.A\\nBernick, Myrna\\n.W\\n   Starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing with\\ncomputers, the experiment in automatic document classification proceeds\\nto construct an\\nempirically based, mathematically derived classification system by use of a\\nfactor analysis technique.. The documents are then classified into these \\nderived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves\\nas a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated..\\nOf the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue\\nwords, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or\\n48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer \\nformula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron\\nin a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of \\nclassification categories and a different computational formula.. The \\nexperimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document \\nclassification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when \\nexecuted should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification \\ntechnique..\\n.X\\n26\\t2\\t564\\n28\\t1\\t564\\n42\\t1\\t564\\n45\\t2\\t564\\n72\\t1\\t564\\n79\\t1\\t564\\n174\\t2\\t564\\n175\\t1\\t564\\n179\\t1\\t564\\n310\\t1\\t564\\n315\\t1\\t564\\n419\\t2\\t564\\n420\\t1\\t564\\n421\\t1\\t564\\n422\\t2\\t564\\n454\\t1\\t564\\n458\\t1\\t564\\n464\\t1\\t564\\n479\\t2\\t564\\n483\\t1\\t564\\n485\\t2\\t564\\n509\\t1\\t564\\n562\\t3\\t564\\n564\\t7\\t564\\n565\\t1\\t564\\n566\\t2\\t564\\n570\\t1\\t564\\n660\\t2\\t564\\n661\\t3\\t564\\n662\\t4\\t564\\n663\\t4\\t564\\n664\\t2\\t564\\n714\\t1\\t564\\n769\\t2\\t564\\n785\\t1\\t564\\n853\\t1\\t564\\n1044\\t1\\t564\\n1117\\t1\\t564\\n1140\\t1\\t564\\n1144\\t1\\t564\\n1154\\t1\\t564\\n1218\\t1\\t564\\n1279\\t1\\t564\\n1327\\t1\\t564\\n1419\\t1\\t564\\n1419\\t1\\t564\\n.I 565\\n.T\\nComputer Evaluation of Indexing and Text Processing\\n.A\\nSalton, G.\\n.A\\nLesk, M.

C.\\n.A\\nKumar, S.\\n.W\\n   A computer procedure to recognize indexing vocabularies is described..Index\\nterms are drawn from the vocabulary of a structured indexing system and may\\nconsist of single words, collection of words, or syntactic phrases.. The basic\\nidea is that a measure of the semantic association between index terms can be \\ndetermined from the structural relationships which the terms exhibit by their\\nrelative positions in the system.. The association measure, which is based on a \\npriori (preassigned) semantic relationships between terms, rather than their \\nco-occurrence in a document corpus, is then for grouping index terms into \\nclusters or concepts..

Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual \\nInference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria\\n.A\\nRush, J. E.\\nSalvador, R.\\nZamora, A.\\n.W\\n   Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors \\nof time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic \\ngeneration of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis\\nto be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval\\nsystems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the\\npurpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the \\nautomatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the \\noriginal document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which \\nvarious methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop \\ncriteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract \\ncan be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to \\nthe abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most\\nsignificant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and\\nrejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence\\nreference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic\\nabstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called \\nthe Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions\\nspecified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of\\nsufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods\\nof the automatic abstracting system is warranted..\\n.X\\n26\\t1\\t571\\n35\\t3\\t571\\n43\\t1\\t571\\n68\\t1\\t571\\n84\\t1\\t571\\n175\\t1\\t571\\n315\\t1\\t571\\n324\\t1\\t571\\n420\\t3\\t571\\n499\\t2\\t571\\n571\\t6\\t571\\n657\\t2\\t571\\n664\\t1\\t571\\n666\\t2\\t571\\n712\\t1\\t571\\n1054\\t1\\t571\\n1281\\t1\\t571\\n1281\\t1\\t571\\n.I 572\\n.T\\nLinguistics and Information Science\\n.A\\nMontgomery, C.A.\\n.W\\n  This paper defines the relationship between linguistics\\nand information science in terms of a common interest\\nin natural language.

Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an\\noverall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem,\\nincorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation,\\nwhich allows one to better understand the contributions made by many \\nresearchers in this crucial area..\\n.X\\n75\\t1\\t575\\n79\\t1\\t575\\n120\\t1\\t575\\n124\\t1\\t575\\n125\\t1\\t575\\n128\\t1\\t575\\n135\\t1\\t575\\n165\\t1\\t575\\n175\\t1\\t575\\n224\\t1\\t575\\n244\\t1\\t575\\n245\\t1\\t575\\n291\\t1\\t575\\n298\\t1\\t575\\n315\\t1\\t575\\n381\\t2\\t575\\n419\\t1\\t575\\n441\\t2\\t575\\n448\\t1\\t575\\n452\\t1\\t575\\n456\\t1\\t575\\n458\\t1\\t575\\n459\\t1\\t575\\n484\\t1\\t575\\n511\\t1\\t575\\n514\\t1\\t575\\n516\\t1\\t575\\n518\\t2\\t575\\n521\\t1\\t575\\n522\\t1\\t575\\n523\\t1\\t575\\n526\\t1\\t575\\n527\\t1\\t575\\n528\\t1\\t575\\n529\\t1\\t575\\n531\\t1\\t575\\n554\\t1\\t575\\n575\\t5\\t575\\n577\\t2\\t575\\n579\\t1\\t575\\n591\\t1\\t575\\n595\\t1\\t575\\n599\\t2\\t575\\n603\\t1\\t575\\n610\\t1\\t575\\n615\\t2\\t575\\n619\\t1\\t575\\n620\\t1\\t575\\n621\\t2\\t575\\n625\\t2\\t575\\n626\\t1\\t575\\n630\\t2\\t575\\n636\\t1\\t575\\n644\\t1\\t575\\n649\\t1\\t575\\n660\\t2\\t575\\n692\\t1\\t575\\n700\\t1\\t575\\n705\\t1\\t575\\n707\\t1\\t575\\n727\\t1\\t575\\n752\\t2\\t575\\n754\\t1\\t575\\n780\\t2\\t575\\n812\\t2\\t575\\n817\\t1\\t575\\n822\\t1\\t575\\n824\\t2\\t575\\n875\\t1\\t575\\n907\\t1\\t575\\n925\\t1\\t575\\n956\\t1\\t575\\n1202\\t1\\t575\\n1282\\t2\\t575\\n1294\\t1\\t575\\n1303\\t1\\t575\\n1327\\t1\\t575\\n1364\\t1\\t575\\n1366\\t1\\t575\\n1367\\t1\\t575\\n1368\\t1\\t575\\n1402\\t1\\t575\\n1402\\t1\\t575\\n.I 576\\n.T\\nClassification of Scientific Documents by Means of Self_Generated Groups \\nEmploying Free Language\\n.A\\nFeinman, R.

The first\\nstage describes an experiment that explores properties\\nof the class of words that are not useful in conveying\\nsubject meaning and distinguishes them from those\\nclasses of words that do convey subject meaning to\\nvarious degrees.  In particular, we study the clustering\\nproperties of these words; the analysis is based on\\nstatistical properties alone, and techniques are\\nintroduced that may be of value in other areas of\\ninformation science.  On the basis of the results of this\\nexperiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced and\\ndiscussed.

It should also provide different levels of services\\nto experienced and inexperienced searchers, recognize the difference between a\\nnarrow and broad query, furnish clues as to the next direction to be searched, \\nrecognize the data base dynamically as the searcher changes his viewpoint, \\nprovide a ranking of responses in the most likely sequence and offer the \\nsearcher the option of overriding the ranking when a particular term is of \\nextreme significance..\\n   An online interactive system meeting many of these needs has been developed\\nand tested.. The objectives of the development of this system, BROWSER, was to\\ninvestigate the effectiveness of a free-form query with a combinatorial search\\nalgorithm and the effectiveness of various techniques and components to \\nfacilitate online browsing..\\n.X\\n61\\t1\\t579\\n63\\t1\\t579\\n124\\t1\\t579\\n127\\t1\\t579\\n129\\t1\\t579\\n161\\t1\\t579\\n172\\t1\\t579\\n175\\t2\\t579\\n190\\t1\\t579\\n191\\t2\\t579\\n194\\t1\\t579\\n197\\t2\\t579\\n211\\t1\\t579\\n212\\t1\\t579\\n214\\t1\\t579\\n218\\t1\\t579\\n224\\t1\\t579\\n243\\t1\\t579\\n274\\t2\\t579\\n298\\t1\\t579\\n307\\t1\\t579\\n320\\t1\\t579\\n330\\t1\\t579\\n332\\t1\\t579\\n348\\t1\\t579\\n375\\t1\\t579\\n378\\t1\\t579\\n381\\t1\\t579\\n389\\t1\\t579\\n390\\t2\\t579\\n417\\t1\\t579\\n445\\t1\\t579\\n446\\t1\\t579\\n450\\t1\\t579\\n451\\t1\\t579\\n452\\t1\\t579\\n454\\t1\\t579\\n456\\t1\\t579\\n458\\t3\\t579\\n459\\t2\\t579\\n468\\t1\\t579\\n472\\t1\\t579\\n484\\t2\\t579\\n485\\t1\\t579\\n487\\t1\\t579\\n492\\t1\\t579\\n502\\t1\\t579\\n503\\t1\\t579\\n506\\t1\\t579\\n507\\t1\\t579\\n508\\t2\\t579\\n511\\t1\\t579\\n512\\t1\\t579\\n514\\t2\\t579\\n518\\t1\\t579\\n520\\t1\\t579\\n523\\t2\\t579\\n524\\t1\\t579\\n525\\t1\\t579\\n526\\t3\\t579\\n528\\t1\\t579\\n529\\t1\\t579\\n530\\t1\\t579\\n534\\t2\\t579\\n546\\t3\\t579\\n553\\t1\\t579\\n554\\t2\\t579\\n572\\t1\\t579\\n575\\t1\\t579\\n577\\t1\\t579\\n579\\t8\\t579\\n591\\t2\\t579\\n593\\t1\\t579\\n594\\t3\\t579\\n595\\t2\\t579\\n596\\t2\\t579\\n597\\t1\\t579\\n599\\t2\\t579\\n600\\t2\\t579\\n601\\t1\\t579\\n603\\t3\\t579\\n604\\t2\\t579\\n606\\t4\\t579\\n609\\t1\\t579\\n610\\t1\\t579\\n611\\t1\\t579\\n612\\t1\\t579\\n615\\t2\\t579\\n619\\t1\\t579\\n620\\t1\\t579\\n621\\t1\\t579\\n625\\t2\\t579\\n626\\t3\\t579\\n630\\t2\\t579\\n636\\t1\\t579\\n637\\t2\\t579\\n640\\t1\\t579\\n642\\t1\\t579\\n648\\t1\\t579\\n650\\t1\\t579\\n692\\t1\\t579\\n696\\t1\\t579\\n699\\t1\\t579\\n703\\t1\\t579\\n705\\t1\\t579\\n708\\t1\\t579\\n723\\t1\\t579\\n724\\t1\\t579\\n726\\t1\\t579\\n727\\t1\\t579\\n728\\t1\\t579\\n731\\t1\\t579\\n732\\t1\\t579\\n733\\t1\\t579\\n734\\t1\\t579\\n736\\t1\\t579\\n738\\t1\\t579\\n739\\t1\\t579\\n740\\t1\\t579\\n741\\t1\\t579\\n742\\t1\\t579\\n743\\t1\\t579\\n744\\t1\\t579\\n752\\t1\\t579\\n754\\t1\\t579\\n755\\t1\\t579\\n780\\t1\\t579\\n799\\t1\\t579\\n801\\t1\\t579\\n805\\t2\\t579\\n806\\t1\\t579\\n807\\t1\\t579\\n814\\t1\\t579\\n820\\t1\\t579\\n822\\t1\\t579\\n826\\t3\\t579\\n827\\t1\\t579\\n830\\t1\\t579\\n836\\t1\\t579\\n863\\t1\\t579\\n864\\t1\\t579\\n866\\t1\\t579\\n867\\t1\\t579\\n879\\t1\\t579\\n883\\t1\\t579\\n902\\t1\\t579\\n907\\t1\\t579\\n956\\t2\\t579\\n963\\t1\\t579\\n987\\t1\\t579\\n988\\t1\\t579\\n989\\t2\\t579\\n1004\\t1\\t579\\n1033\\t1\\t579\\n1035\\t2\\t579\\n1078\\t1\\t579\\n1084\\t1\\t579\\n1089\\t1\\t579\\n1091\\t1\\t579\\n1152\\t1\\t579\\n1207\\t1\\t579\\n1264\\t1\\t579\\n1265\\t1\\t579\\n1279\\t1\\t579\\n1294\\t1\\t579\\n1297\\t1\\t579\\n1298\\t1\\t579\\n1299\\t1\\t579\\n1303\\t1\\t579\\n1327\\t2\\t579\\n1356\\t1\\t579\\n1364\\t1\\t579\\n1368\\t1\\t579\\n1370\\t1\\t579\\n1372\\t1\\t579\\n1373\\t1\\t579\\n1374\\t2\\t579\\n1375\\t1\\t579\\n1376\\t1\\t579\\n1377\\t1\\t579\\n1387\\t1\\t579\\n1405\\t1\\t579\\n1427\\t1\\t579\\n1427\\t1\\t579\\n.I 580\\n.T\\nOverlap in the Lists of Journals Monitored by Biosis, CAS, and Ei\\n.A\\nWood, James L.\\nFlanagan, Carolyn\\nKennedy, H.

Subsequent phases of the study\\nwill determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within\\nthe journals..\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t580\\n18\\t1\\t580\\n65\\t1\\t580\\n91\\t1\\t580\\n125\\t2\\t580\\n127\\t1\\t580\\n129\\t1\\t580\\n145\\t1\\t580\\n162\\t1\\t580\\n211\\t1\\t580\\n243\\t1\\t580\\n253\\t1\\t580\\n363\\t1\\t580\\n378\\t1\\t580\\n421\\t1\\t580\\n432\\t1\\t580\\n439\\t1\\t580\\n440\\t2\\t580\\n452\\t1\\t580\\n453\\t1\\t580\\n460\\t1\\t580\\n461\\t1\\t580\\n467\\t1\\t580\\n468\\t1\\t580\\n495\\t1\\t580\\n506\\t1\\t580\\n508\\t1\\t580\\n511\\t1\\t580\\n512\\t1\\t580\\n514\\t1\\t580\\n517\\t1\\t580\\n520\\t1\\t580\\n521\\t1\\t580\\n523\\t1\\t580\\n524\\t1\\t580\\n526\\t1\\t580\\n528\\t1\\t580\\n576\\t1\\t580\\n580\\t16\\t580\\n604\\t2\\t580\\n609\\t2\\t580\\n612\\t1\\t580\\n619\\t1\\t580\\n622\\t6\\t580\\n623\\t1\\t580\\n629\\t1\\t580\\n631\\t1\\t580\\n632\\t1\\t580\\n633\\t1\\t580\\n642\\t1\\t580\\n643\\t1\\t580\\n644\\t1\\t580\\n645\\t1\\t580\\n646\\t1\\t580\\n649\\t1\\t580\\n650\\t1\\t580\\n696\\t2\\t580\\n699\\t1\\t580\\n700\\t1\\t580\\n705\\t2\\t580\\n707\\t1\\t580\\n708\\t1\\t580\\n723\\t1\\t580\\n726\\t1\\t580\\n727\\t2\\t580\\n728\\t2\\t580\\n729\\t2\\t580\\n730\\t1\\t580\\n731\\t1\\t580\\n736\\t1\\t580\\n737\\t1\\t580\\n738\\t1\\t580\\n739\\t1\\t580\\n741\\t1\\t580\\n754\\t1\\t580\\n770\\t1\\t580\\n776\\t1\\t580\\n809\\t1\\t580\\n812\\t1\\t580\\n813\\t2\\t580\\n814\\t1\\t580\\n820\\t1\\t580\\n822\\t1\\t580\\n866\\t1\\t580\\n870\\t2\\t580\\n873\\t1\\t580\\n981\\t1\\t580\\n1078\\t1\\t580\\n1089\\t1\\t580\\n1091\\t1\\t580\\n1143\\t1\\t580\\n1208\\t1\\t580\\n1264\\t1\\t580\\n1298\\t1\\t580\\n1302\\t1\\t580\\n1303\\t1\\t580\\n1366\\t1\\t580\\n1367\\t1\\t580\\n1368\\t1\\t580\\n1374\\t1\\t580\\n1376\\t1\\t580\\n1396\\t2\\t580\\n1396\\t2\\t580\\n.I 581\\n.T\\nStructure and Effectiveness of The Citation Identifier, an\\nOperational Computer Program for Automatic Identification of Case\\nCitations in Legal Literature\\n.A\\nBorkowski, Casimir\\nCepanec, Louis\\nMartin, J. Sperling\\nSalko, Virginia\\nTreu, Siegfried\\n.W\\n   A computer program for automatic identification of \"full form\" case\\ncitations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall. 220,\\n18 L. Ed. 343; Southland Industries, Inc. v. Federal Communications\\nCommission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developed\\nby this group and is now operational.. \\n   The level of performance of this program known as \"The Citation\\nIdentifier\" is high.. In a recent computer run, The Citation\\nIdentifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions\\nof U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and \\nlocated correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227\\n(that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and three\\nfalse drops occurred..\\n   Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) were\\nidentified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identifications\\ncontaining two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which some\\ncitation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program (\"short hits\");\\nand (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly included\\nin the citations (\"long hits\").\\n   Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible and\\ncan be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program..\\n   The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run,\\nthe total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text\\nwas approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increased\\nby suitable changes in the computer program..\\n   An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g.,\\n\"the Geddes decision\", \"the Southland Industries case\") is now in preparation..    \\n.X\\n30\\t1\\t581\\n38\\t1\\t581\\n51\\t1\\t581\\n69\\t1\\t581\\n71\\t2\\t581\\n75\\t1\\t581\\n77\\t3\\t581\\n78\\t1\\t581\\n79\\t3\\t581\\n80\\t1\\t581\\n81\\t1\\t581\\n82\\t1\\t581\\n83\\t1\\t581\\n84\\t1\\t581\\n154\\t1\\t581\\n168\\t2\\t581\\n175\\t1\\t581\\n176\\t1\\t581\\n212\\t1\\t581\\n247\\t1\\t581\\n315\\t2\\t581\\n317\\t1\\t581\\n320\\t1\\t581\\n382\\t1\\t581\\n420\\t1\\t581\\n448\\t1\\t581\\n480\\t1\\t581\\n483\\t1\\t581\\n484\\t1\\t581\\n486\\t1\\t581\\n488\\t3\\t581\\n489\\t2\\t581\\n490\\t2\\t581\\n491\\t3\\t581\\n492\\t2\\t581\\n493\\t3\\t581\\n494\\t1\\t581\\n495\\t1\\t581\\n496\\t2\\t581\\n497\\t2\\t581\\n498\\t2\\t581\\n499\\t3\\t581\\n500\\t1\\t581\\n503\\t1\\t581\\n507\\t1\\t581\\n509\\t1\\t581\\n510\\t1\\t581\\n512\\t1\\t581\\n517\\t1\\t581\\n520\\t1\\t581\\n522\\t1\\t581\\n527\\t1\\t581\\n528\\t1\\t581\\n531\\t1\\t581\\n565\\t1\\t581\\n566\\t1\\t581\\n570\\t1\\t581\\n581\\t6\\t581\\n583\\t1\\t581\\n584\\t1\\t581\\n586\\t1\\t581\\n596\\t1\\t581\\n603\\t1\\t581\\n608\\t1\\t581\\n633\\t1\\t581\\n659\\t3\\t581\\n666\\t2\\t581\\n715\\t1\\t581\\n754\\t1\\t581\\n790\\t2\\t581\\n795\\t1\\t581\\n801\\t1\\t581\\n805\\t1\\t581\\n809\\t1\\t581\\n810\\t1\\t581\\n812\\t1\\t581\\n813\\t1\\t581\\n814\\t1\\t581\\n817\\t1\\t581\\n824\\t1\\t581\\n825\\t1\\t581\\n838\\t1\\t581\\n853\\t1\\t581\\n894\\t1\\t581\\n986\\t1\\t581\\n1035\\t1\\t581\\n1051\\t1\\t581\\n1294\\t4\\t581\\n1327\\t1\\t581\\n1393\\t1\\t581\\n1419\\t1\\t581\\n1427\\t1\\t581\\n1431\\t1\\t581\\n1443\\t1\\t581\\n1443\\t1\\t581\\n.I 582\\n.T\\nTitle Indexes as Alerting Services in the Chemical and Life Sciences\\n.A\\nBottle, Robert T.\\n.W\\n   The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alerting\\nservices (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large \\nquantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible..\\nAs title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user \\nneeds to know how much significant information is not discernible from a \\ndocuments title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and\\ntype of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made,\\nignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one\\nthird of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other\\nnomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two \\nmost important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for \\nsome typical services..\\n.X\\n35\\t1\\t582\\n38\\t3\\t582\\n42\\t1\\t582\\n43\\t1\\t582\\n52\\t2\\t582\\n70\\t1\\t582\\n73\\t1\\t582\\n76\\t1\\t582\\n81\\t1\\t582\\n89\\t1\\t582\\n91\\t1\\t582\\n95\\t2\\t582\\n104\\t1\\t582\\n105\\t1\\t582\\n110\\t2\\t582\\n150\\t2\\t582\\n155\\t1\\t582\\n157\\t1\\t582\\n159\\t1\\t582\\n161\\t1\\t582\\n166\\t1\\t582\\n257\\t1\\t582\\n314\\t1\\t582\\n348\\t1\\t582\\n356\\t1\\t582\\n420\\t1\\t582\\n429\\t3\\t582\\n489\\t1\\t582\\n491\\t1\\t582\\n493\\t1\\t582\\n496\\t1\\t582\\n498\\t1\\t582\\n501\\t1\\t582\\n510\\t2\\t582\\n513\\t2\\t582\\n514\\t1\\t582\\n520\\t1\\t582\\n544\\t1\\t582\\n560\\t1\\t582\\n578\\t1\\t582\\n582\\t16\\t582\\n583\\t2\\t582\\n584\\t1\\t582\\n588\\t1\\t582\\n589\\t5\\t582\\n594\\t1\\t582\\n595\\t1\\t582\\n603\\t3\\t582\\n613\\t1\\t582\\n614\\t1\\t582\\n618\\t1\\t582\\n653\\t1\\t582\\n655\\t3\\t582\\n656\\t2\\t582\\n657\\t3\\t582\\n685\\t2\\t582\\n686\\t1\\t582\\n688\\t1\\t582\\n690\\t1\\t582\\n691\\t1\\t582\\n721\\t1\\t582\\n722\\t3\\t582\\n724\\t1\\t582\\n725\\t1\\t582\\n726\\t1\\t582\\n755\\t1\\t582\\n770\\t1\\t582\\n776\\t2\\t582\\n796\\t1\\t582\\n797\\t1\\t582\\n798\\t1\\t582\\n801\\t1\\t582\\n802\\t1\\t582\\n813\\t1\\t582\\n820\\t1\\t582\\n822\\t1\\t582\\n827\\t1\\t582\\n859\\t1\\t582\\n958\\t1\\t582\\n987\\t1\\t582\\n988\\t1\\t582\\n1012\\t1\\t582\\n1030\\t2\\t582\\n1050\\t1\\t582\\n1054\\t1\\t582\\n1062\\t1\\t582\\n1089\\t1\\t582\\n1091\\t1\\t582\\n1097\\t1\\t582\\n1154\\t1\\t582\\n1176\\t1\\t582\\n1195\\t1\\t582\\n1208\\t1\\t582\\n1232\\t1\\t582\\n1256\\t1\\t582\\n1281\\t1\\t582\\n1284\\t1\\t582\\n1285\\t1\\t582\\n1287\\t1\\t582\\n1290\\t1\\t582\\n1291\\t1\\t582\\n1293\\t3\\t582\\n1294\\t1\\t582\\n1295\\t3\\t582\\n1296\\t2\\t582\\n1297\\t2\\t582\\n1298\\t1\\t582\\n1300\\t1\\t582\\n1302\\t1\\t582\\n1319\\t1\\t582\\n1346\\t1\\t582\\n1362\\t1\\t582\\n1363\\t1\\t582\\n1386\\t1\\t582\\n1405\\t1\\t582\\n1448\\t1\\t582\\n1448\\t1\\t582\\n.I 583\\n.T\\nEvaluation of a KWIC Index for Library Literature\\n.A\\nBrodie, N.E.\\n.W\\n  A librarian attempting to do a literature search currently\\nfaces an eight-month gap in access to the literature of\\nhis field through Library Literature.

The fundamental character of the\\nphenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and\\ncommunication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by several\\nfactors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information-\\noriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied,\\na common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned\\nin some form or other with information on one side and man\\'s relationship\\nto the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascience\\nof information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems\\nfor which the science has to provide answers and solutions..

The major causes of Medlars precision failures \\nwere inadequate indexing terminalogy to express concepts and attempts at\\nproviding too exhaustive a search..\\n.X\\n38\\t2\\t586\\n43\\t1\\t586\\n47\\t1\\t586\\n50\\t1\\t586\\n65\\t1\\t586\\n66\\t1\\t586\\n75\\t2\\t586\\n84\\t1\\t586\\n86\\t1\\t586\\n175\\t2\\t586\\n211\\t1\\t586\\n382\\t2\\t586\\n389\\t1\\t586\\n390\\t1\\t586\\n488\\t1\\t586\\n489\\t1\\t586\\n490\\t1\\t586\\n491\\t1\\t586\\n492\\t1\\t586\\n493\\t1\\t586\\n494\\t1\\t586\\n495\\t1\\t586\\n496\\t1\\t586\\n497\\t1\\t586\\n499\\t1\\t586\\n500\\t1\\t586\\n514\\t1\\t586\\n520\\t1\\t586\\n565\\t1\\t586\\n570\\t1\\t586\\n576\\t1\\t586\\n581\\t1\\t586\\n583\\t2\\t586\\n584\\t1\\t586\\n586\\t6\\t586\\n591\\t1\\t586\\n603\\t1\\t586\\n608\\t3\\t586\\n610\\t1\\t586\\n636\\t1\\t586\\n643\\t1\\t586\\n659\\t2\\t586\\n778\\t1\\t586\\n791\\t1\\t586\\n795\\t1\\t586\\n801\\t1\\t586\\n820\\t1\\t586\\n894\\t1\\t586\\n958\\t1\\t586\\n986\\t2\\t586\\n1035\\t1\\t586\\n1144\\t1\\t586\\n1213\\t1\\t586\\n1294\\t2\\t586\\n1313\\t1\\t586\\n1327\\t2\\t586\\n1419\\t1\\t586\\n1419\\t1\\t586\\n.I 587\\n.T\\nObsolescence of Special Library Periodicals: Sampling Errors and\\nUtility Contours\\n.A\\nBrookes, B. C.\\n.W\\n   Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets\\nof periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large\\nerrors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are \\nanalyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and\\nbecause they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on\\nobsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..\\n   When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still\\nremains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals\\nthat contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than\\nthose of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept\\nof \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p%\\nlibrary..\\n   It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; \\nevery special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest\\nnew measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that\\nare applicable to any other special case..\\n.X\\n33\\t2\\t587\\n36\\t2\\t587\\n41\\t1\\t587\\n57\\t1\\t587\\n73\\t1\\t587\\n89\\t1\\t587\\n97\\t1\\t587\\n102\\t1\\t587\\n106\\t1\\t587\\n111\\t1\\t587\\n112\\t1\\t587\\n149\\t1\\t587\\n155\\t1\\t587\\n163\\t1\\t587\\n175\\t1\\t587\\n183\\t1\\t587\\n184\\t2\\t587\\n193\\t2\\t587\\n195\\t1\\t587\\n199\\t1\\t587\\n201\\t1\\t587\\n203\\t2\\t587\\n204\\t1\\t587\\n205\\t1\\t587\\n210\\t1\\t587\\n222\\t1\\t587\\n225\\t2\\t587\\n228\\t1\\t587\\n229\\t1\\t587\\n233\\t1\\t587\\n267\\t2\\t587\\n269\\t1\\t587\\n314\\t1\\t587\\n359\\t2\\t587\\n373\\t1\\t587\\n395\\t1\\t587\\n494\\t2\\t587\\n515\\t1\\t587\\n519\\t1\\t587\\n545\\t1\\t587\\n552\\t1\\t587\\n587\\t15\\t587\\n605\\t1\\t587\\n613\\t1\\t587\\n614\\t1\\t587\\n638\\t1\\t587\\n667\\t1\\t587\\n713\\t1\\t587\\n735\\t1\\t587\\n747\\t1\\t587\\n748\\t1\\t587\\n750\\t5\\t587\\n751\\t2\\t587\\n753\\t1\\t587\\n759\\t1\\t587\\n764\\t2\\t587\\n765\\t1\\t587\\n766\\t1\\t587\\n767\\t3\\t587\\n775\\t3\\t587\\n778\\t2\\t587\\n780\\t1\\t587\\n782\\t1\\t587\\n784\\t1\\t587\\n787\\t1\\t587\\n788\\t1\\t587\\n789\\t1\\t587\\n791\\t1\\t587\\n792\\t4\\t587\\n793\\t7\\t587\\n794\\t5\\t587\\n800\\t7\\t587\\n804\\t1\\t587\\n808\\t3\\t587\\n823\\t1\\t587\\n824\\t1\\t587\\n829\\t1\\t587\\n840\\t1\\t587\\n895\\t1\\t587\\n905\\t1\\t587\\n925\\t1\\t587\\n948\\t1\\t587\\n953\\t1\\t587\\n977\\t1\\t587\\n983\\t1\\t587\\n1016\\t1\\t587\\n1023\\t1\\t587\\n1030\\t1\\t587\\n1055\\t1\\t587\\n1081\\t1\\t587\\n1082\\t1\\t587\\n1083\\t1\\t587\\n1085\\t2\\t587\\n1086\\t2\\t587\\n1087\\t1\\t587\\n1090\\t1\\t587\\n1091\\t1\\t587\\n1123\\t1\\t587\\n1135\\t1\\t587\\n1201\\t1\\t587\\n1219\\t1\\t587\\n1222\\t1\\t587\\n1260\\t1\\t587\\n1275\\t1\\t587\\n1276\\t1\\t587\\n1278\\t2\\t587\\n1280\\t1\\t587\\n1282\\t1\\t587\\n1285\\t4\\t587\\n1286\\t1\\t587\\n1287\\t2\\t587\\n1302\\t1\\t587\\n1307\\t1\\t587\\n1308\\t1\\t587\\n1324\\t1\\t587\\n1335\\t1\\t587\\n1390\\t1\\t587\\n1397\\t1\\t587\\n1401\\t1\\t587\\n1416\\t1\\t587\\n1417\\t3\\t587\\n1418\\t1\\t587\\n1428\\t1\\t587\\n1432\\t1\\t587\\n1432\\t1\\t587\\n.I 588\\n.T\\nCardiovascular Serial Literature: Characteristics, Productive\\nJournals, and Abstracting/Indexing Coverage\\n.A\\nFrick, Barbara F.\\n.A\\nGinski, John M.\\n.W\\n   Two groups of journals were identified as potential sources for\\ncardiovascular (c-v) information.. The first group consists of 78 c-v\\nspecialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title..\\nThese 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty\\njournals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The\\nsecond group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of\\nthe National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings..\\n   In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported\\nto NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S.\\nc-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the\\nmost quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14%\\nof American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the\\nliterature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v \\njournals..\\n   The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and\\nabstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking\\njournals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t588\\n36\\t1\\t588\\n90\\t1\\t588\\n91\\t1\\t588\\n161\\t1\\t588\\n183\\t1\\t588\\n184\\t1\\t588\\n193\\t1\\t588\\n198\\t1\\t588\\n199\\t1\\t588\\n201\\t1\\t588\\n202\\t1\\t588\\n203\\t1\\t588\\n204\\t1\\t588\\n205\\t1\\t588\\n209\\t1\\t588\\n212\\t1\\t588\\n217\\t1\\t588\\n220\\t1\\t588\\n222\\t1\\t588\\n284\\t1\\t588\\n286\\t1\\t588\\n294\\t1\\t588\\n379\\t1\\t588\\n429\\t1\\t588\\n513\\t1\\t588\\n543\\t1\\t588\\n582\\t1\\t588\\n588\\t6\\t588\\n589\\t1\\t588\\n603\\t1\\t588\\n613\\t3\\t588\\n614\\t1\\t588\\n616\\t1\\t588\\n618\\t1\\t588\\n624\\t1\\t588\\n657\\t1\\t588\\n685\\t2\\t588\\n686\\t1\\t588\\n691\\t1\\t588\\n721\\t1\\t588\\n722\\t1\\t588\\n724\\t1\\t588\\n725\\t1\\t588\\n735\\t1\\t588\\n775\\t1\\t588\\n793\\t1\\t588\\n799\\t1\\t588\\n800\\t1\\t588\\n808\\t1\\t588\\n821\\t1\\t588\\n958\\t1\\t588\\n959\\t1\\t588\\n987\\t1\\t588\\n988\\t1\\t588\\n1010\\t1\\t588\\n1086\\t1\\t588\\n1087\\t1\\t588\\n1151\\t1\\t588\\n1208\\t1\\t588\\n1275\\t1\\t588\\n1283\\t1\\t588\\n1290\\t1\\t588\\n1293\\t1\\t588\\n1302\\t2\\t588\\n1355\\t1\\t588\\n1355\\t1\\t588\\n.I 589\\n.T\\nAre Titles of Chemical Papers Becoming More Informative?\\n.A\\nTocatlian, Jacques J.\\n.W\\n   The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and\\ntheir numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors\\' choices of titles\\nfor their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services,\\nsuch as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but\\nalso in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such\\nas bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles\\nof chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become\\nincreasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information..\\nThe present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers\\nare becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical\\npapers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958..\\n   The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, \\n1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words\\nin the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading\\nsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a\\nthesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading\\nsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of\\na thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of\\nshort titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958,\\nand 1968..\\n   Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are\\nbeing eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative\\nsince the advent of the KWIC index..  \\n.X\\n35\\t1\\t589\\n38\\t2\\t589\\n42\\t1\\t589\\n43\\t1\\t589\\n52\\t3\\t589\\n53\\t1\\t589\\n70\\t1\\t589\\n73\\t1\\t589\\n76\\t1\\t589\\n81\\t1\\t589\\n88\\t1\\t589\\n89\\t1\\t589\\n91\\t1\\t589\\n95\\t2\\t589\\n104\\t1\\t589\\n110\\t1\\t589\\n150\\t4\\t589\\n161\\t1\\t589\\n175\\t2\\t589\\n384\\t1\\t589\\n390\\t1\\t589\\n420\\t1\\t589\\n429\\t2\\t589\\n503\\t2\\t589\\n510\\t1\\t589\\n513\\t1\\t589\\n517\\t1\\t589\\n560\\t1\\t589\\n576\\t2\\t589\\n578\\t1\\t589\\n582\\t5\\t589\\n584\\t1\\t589\\n588\\t1\\t589\\n589\\t14\\t589\\n594\\t1\\t589\\n595\\t1\\t589\\n603\\t3\\t589\\n613\\t1\\t589\\n614\\t1\\t589\\n618\\t1\\t589\\n655\\t2\\t589\\n656\\t1\\t589\\n657\\t4\\t589\\n685\\t1\\t589\\n686\\t1\\t589\\n691\\t1\\t589\\n711\\t1\\t589\\n721\\t1\\t589\\n722\\t4\\t589\\n724\\t1\\t589\\n725\\t1\\t589\\n820\\t1\\t589\\n830\\t1\\t589\\n958\\t1\\t589\\n987\\t1\\t589\\n988\\t1\\t589\\n1054\\t1\\t589\\n1089\\t1\\t589\\n1144\\t2\\t589\\n1154\\t1\\t589\\n1195\\t3\\t589\\n1208\\t1\\t589\\n1232\\t1\\t589\\n1256\\t1\\t589\\n1281\\t2\\t589\\n1287\\t1\\t589\\n1293\\t1\\t589\\n1295\\t1\\t589\\n1297\\t1\\t589\\n1298\\t1\\t589\\n1300\\t1\\t589\\n1302\\t1\\t589\\n1421\\t1\\t589\\n1421\\t1\\t589\\n.I 590\\n.T\\nToward a Theory of Indexing--II\\n.A\\nLandry, Bertrand C.\\n.A\\nRush, James E.\\n.W\\n   The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a\\ntheory of information storage and retrieval.. It is believed that this theory\\ncan best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing.. After stating\\nbasic premises and defining essential concepts, the relationship between a \\ntheory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is \\nconsidered.. The similarities between the indexing process and the general\\ncommunication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order \\nincreasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoretical\\nindex is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems.. The\\nrelationship between query formulation, retrieval, and benefit is discussed, \\nand these notions are then related to the human performance variable.

The system is designed to handle\\nlarge amounts of highly variable information which it processes on \\ncommand, giving on-line computer service for all library operations..\\nAt the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills\\nof a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained\\nlibrarians..\\n   Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical\\nof large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper\\ndiscusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove\\nuseful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display\\nformat, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability\\nfor the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter\\nmnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line\\nnumbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of\\ndefault conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification;\\nand collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..\\n.X\\n66\\t1\\t593\\n78\\t1\\t593\\n161\\t1\\t593\\n175\\t1\\t593\\n197\\t2\\t593\\n218\\t1\\t593\\n332\\t1\\t593\\n375\\t1\\t593\\n445\\t1\\t593\\n454\\t1\\t593\\n472\\t1\\t593\\n503\\t1\\t593\\n506\\t1\\t593\\n507\\t1\\t593\\n546\\t1\\t593\\n547\\t1\\t593\\n554\\t1\\t593\\n579\\t1\\t593\\n585\\t1\\t593\\n591\\t1\\t593\\n592\\t1\\t593\\n593\\t5\\t593\\n594\\t2\\t593\\n595\\t2\\t593\\n596\\t1\\t593\\n597\\t1\\t593\\n599\\t1\\t593\\n600\\t1\\t593\\n603\\t1\\t593\\n604\\t1\\t593\\n606\\t2\\t593\\n723\\t1\\t593\\n724\\t1\\t593\\n801\\t1\\t593\\n805\\t1\\t593\\n806\\t1\\t593\\n836\\t1\\t593\\n866\\t1\\t593\\n867\\t1\\t593\\n956\\t1\\t593\\n989\\t1\\t593\\n1035\\t1\\t593\\n1298\\t1\\t593\\n1299\\t1\\t593\\n1309\\t1\\t593\\n1327\\t1\\t593\\n1405\\t1\\t593\\n1405\\t1\\t593\\n.I 594\\n.T\\nOn-Line Systems: Promise and Pitfalls\\n.A\\nCuadra, Carlos A.\\n.W\\n   Interactive systems, in existence for nearly 15 years, are becoming\\nincreasingly important, both for information retrieval and library support\\noperations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and -\\nif time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost of\\nthe large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still-\\nhigh cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user-\\nsystem interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces\\nare only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the\\nNational Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental\\nretrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering\\nthe right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, \\nconcerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls here\\ninclude overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account\\nthe social context around the user terminal.. The major national problem\\nis to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing\\nnationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data\\nbases that will be readily available during the next few years.. We do\\nnot need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential of\\non-line systems, but we do need breakthroughs in organizing for\\ntechnological change..\\n.X\\n35\\t1\\t594\\n42\\t1\\t594\\n43\\t1\\t594\\n52\\t1\\t594\\n66\\t1\\t594\\n70\\t1\\t594\\n73\\t1\\t594\\n75\\t1\\t594\\n81\\t1\\t594\\n95\\t1\\t594\\n124\\t2\\t594\\n127\\t1\\t594\\n129\\t1\\t594\\n145\\t1\\t594\\n161\\t1\\t594\\n190\\t1\\t594\\n191\\t2\\t594\\n197\\t3\\t594\\n211\\t2\\t594\\n214\\t1\\t594\\n218\\t3\\t594\\n235\\t1\\t594\\n243\\t2\\t594\\n253\\t1\\t594\\n289\\t1\\t594\\n291\\t1\\t594\\n307\\t1\\t594\\n312\\t1\\t594\\n330\\t1\\t594\\n332\\t2\\t594\\n375\\t2\\t594\\n378\\t1\\t594\\n382\\t1\\t594\\n408\\t1\\t594\\n420\\t1\\t594\\n445\\t1\\t594\\n450\\t1\\t594\\n451\\t1\\t594\\n452\\t2\\t594\\n454\\t1\\t594\\n459\\t3\\t594\\n468\\t1\\t594\\n472\\t1\\t594\\n475\\t1\\t594\\n484\\t2\\t594\\n492\\t2\\t594\\n497\\t1\\t594\\n503\\t1\\t594\\n505\\t1\\t594\\n506\\t2\\t594\\n507\\t2\\t594\\n508\\t3\\t594\\n510\\t1\\t594\\n511\\t1\\t594\\n512\\t1\\t594\\n514\\t2\\t594\\n518\\t1\\t594\\n520\\t1\\t594\\n523\\t3\\t594\\n524\\t1\\t594\\n525\\t1\\t594\\n526\\t2\\t594\\n528\\t1\\t594\\n529\\t1\\t594\\n530\\t1\\t594\\n532\\t1\\t594\\n533\\t1\\t594\\n534\\t2\\t594\\n546\\t4\\t594\\n547\\t2\\t594\\n548\\t2\\t594\\n553\\t1\\t594\\n554\\t1\\t594\\n578\\t1\\t594\\n579\\t3\\t594\\n582\\t1\\t594\\n589\\t1\\t594\\n591\\t1\\t594\\n593\\t2\\t594\\n594\\t14\\t594\\n595\\t2\\t594\\n596\\t1\\t594\\n597\\t2\\t594\\n598\\t2\\t594\\n599\\t1\\t594\\n600\\t1\\t594\\n601\\t2\\t594\\n602\\t1\\t594\\n603\\t2\\t594\\n604\\t4\\t594\\n606\\t6\\t594\\n607\\t1\\t594\\n609\\t1\\t594\\n610\\t1\\t594\\n611\\t2\\t594\\n612\\t1\\t594\\n619\\t1\\t594\\n625\\t1\\t594\\n626\\t2\\t594\\n630\\t1\\t594\\n636\\t1\\t594\\n637\\t2\\t594\\n642\\t1\\t594\\n648\\t1\\t594\\n650\\t1\\t594\\n655\\t1\\t594\\n656\\t1\\t594\\n657\\t1\\t594\\n692\\t1\\t594\\n696\\t1\\t594\\n699\\t1\\t594\\n703\\t1\\t594\\n705\\t1\\t594\\n708\\t1\\t594\\n723\\t1\\t594\\n724\\t1\\t594\\n726\\t1\\t594\\n727\\t1\\t594\\n728\\t3\\t594\\n731\\t1\\t594\\n732\\t1\\t594\\n733\\t2\\t594\\n734\\t1\\t594\\n736\\t1\\t594\\n738\\t1\\t594\\n739\\t1\\t594\\n740\\t1\\t594\\n741\\t1\\t594\\n742\\t1\\t594\\n743\\t1\\t594\\n744\\t1\\t594\\n755\\t1\\t594\\n801\\t1\\t594\\n805\\t1\\t594\\n806\\t1\\t594\\n820\\t1\\t594\\n826\\t2\\t594\\n827\\t1\\t594\\n830\\t1\\t594\\n836\\t2\\t594\\n863\\t1\\t594\\n864\\t1\\t594\\n865\\t1\\t594\\n866\\t3\\t594\\n867\\t2\\t594\\n868\\t1\\t594\\n879\\t1\\t594\\n883\\t1\\t594\\n885\\t1\\t594\\n897\\t1\\t594\\n916\\t1\\t594\\n936\\t1\\t594\\n956\\t1\\t594\\n972\\t1\\t594\\n989\\t1\\t594\\n1004\\t1\\t594\\n1035\\t2\\t594\\n1042\\t1\\t594\\n1051\\t1\\t594\\n1052\\t1\\t594\\n1054\\t1\\t594\\n1078\\t1\\t594\\n1087\\t1\\t594\\n1089\\t1\\t594\\n1091\\t1\\t594\\n1154\\t1\\t594\\n1207\\t1\\t594\\n1232\\t1\\t594\\n1248\\t1\\t594\\n1264\\t1\\t594\\n1281\\t1\\t594\\n1284\\t1\\t594\\n1295\\t1\\t594\\n1297\\t1\\t594\\n1298\\t2\\t594\\n1299\\t1\\t594\\n1303\\t6\\t594\\n1327\\t2\\t594\\n1356\\t1\\t594\\n1364\\t1\\t594\\n1368\\t2\\t594\\n1370\\t1\\t594\\n1372\\t1\\t594\\n1373\\t1\\t594\\n1374\\t2\\t594\\n1375\\t1\\t594\\n1376\\t1\\t594\\n1377\\t1\\t594\\n1405\\t1\\t594\\n1427\\t1\\t594\\n1427\\t1\\t594\\n.I 595\\n.T\\nSelected Results From An Inquiry Into Testing of\\nInformation Retrieval Systems \\n.A\\nSaracevic, Tefko\\n.W\\n   A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were\\nexamined..

In\\naddition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate\\nthe problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main\\nconclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all\\ncomponents of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance\\nconsiderably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search\\nstrategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more\\nthan indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only\\non a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific..\\nIt seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all\\nfactors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..  \\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t595\\n28\\t1\\t595\\n34\\t1\\t595\\n35\\t1\\t595\\n42\\t1\\t595\\n43\\t1\\t595\\n49\\t1\\t595\\n52\\t1\\t595\\n53\\t1\\t595\\n57\\t1\\t595\\n59\\t1\\t595\\n68\\t1\\t595\\n70\\t1\\t595\\n73\\t1\\t595\\n75\\t1\\t595\\n77\\t1\\t595\\n78\\t1\\t595\\n79\\t1\\t595\\n81\\t1\\t595\\n95\\t1\\t595\\n157\\t1\\t595\\n161\\t1\\t595\\n164\\t1\\t595\\n175\\t2\\t595\\n176\\t1\\t595\\n197\\t1\\t595\\n202\\t1\\t595\\n213\\t1\\t595\\n224\\t2\\t595\\n243\\t1\\t595\\n298\\t1\\t595\\n329\\t1\\t595\\n375\\t1\\t595\\n381\\t2\\t595\\n389\\t1\\t595\\n420\\t2\\t595\\n421\\t1\\t595\\n445\\t1\\t595\\n454\\t1\\t595\\n456\\t1\\t595\\n458\\t1\\t595\\n465\\t1\\t595\\n466\\t1\\t595\\n468\\t1\\t595\\n472\\t1\\t595\\n490\\t1\\t595\\n491\\t1\\t595\\n503\\t1\\t595\\n506\\t2\\t595\\n507\\t2\\t595\\n510\\t1\\t595\\n512\\t1\\t595\\n514\\t2\\t595\\n518\\t1\\t595\\n554\\t2\\t595\\n565\\t3\\t595\\n572\\t1\\t595\\n575\\t1\\t595\\n578\\t1\\t595\\n579\\t2\\t595\\n582\\t1\\t595\\n585\\t1\\t595\\n589\\t1\\t595\\n591\\t3\\t595\\n592\\t1\\t595\\n593\\t2\\t595\\n594\\t2\\t595\\n595\\t10\\t595\\n596\\t2\\t595\\n597\\t1\\t595\\n599\\t2\\t595\\n600\\t1\\t595\\n603\\t3\\t595\\n604\\t2\\t595\\n606\\t1\\t595\\n608\\t1\\t595\\n615\\t2\\t595\\n619\\t2\\t595\\n620\\t1\\t595\\n621\\t1\\t595\\n622\\t1\\t595\\n623\\t1\\t595\\n625\\t1\\t595\\n629\\t1\\t595\\n630\\t1\\t595\\n633\\t1\\t595\\n639\\t1\\t595\\n646\\t1\\t595\\n655\\t1\\t595\\n656\\t1\\t595\\n657\\t1\\t595\\n659\\t1\\t595\\n676\\t1\\t595\\n711\\t1\\t595\\n722\\t1\\t595\\n723\\t2\\t595\\n724\\t1\\t595\\n726\\t1\\t595\\n728\\t1\\t595\\n730\\t1\\t595\\n731\\t1\\t595\\n732\\t1\\t595\\n752\\t2\\t595\\n762\\t1\\t595\\n780\\t1\\t595\\n785\\t1\\t595\\n790\\t1\\t595\\n801\\t1\\t595\\n805\\t1\\t595\\n806\\t1\\t595\\n809\\t1\\t595\\n810\\t2\\t595\\n812\\t1\\t595\\n813\\t2\\t595\\n814\\t2\\t595\\n820\\t2\\t595\\n822\\t3\\t595\\n827\\t1\\t595\\n828\\t1\\t595\\n829\\t1\\t595\\n836\\t1\\t595\\n866\\t1\\t595\\n867\\t1\\t595\\n870\\t2\\t595\\n879\\t1\\t595\\n894\\t1\\t595\\n895\\t1\\t595\\n907\\t1\\t595\\n928\\t1\\t595\\n956\\t2\\t595\\n963\\t1\\t595\\n989\\t1\\t595\\n990\\t1\\t595\\n991\\t1\\t595\\n1054\\t1\\t595\\n1091\\t2\\t595\\n1118\\t1\\t595\\n1124\\t1\\t595\\n1131\\t1\\t595\\n1154\\t1\\t595\\n1232\\t1\\t595\\n1255\\t1\\t595\\n1281\\t2\\t595\\n1282\\t1\\t595\\n1283\\t1\\t595\\n1295\\t1\\t595\\n1298\\t3\\t595\\n1299\\t2\\t595\\n1309\\t1\\t595\\n1327\\t2\\t595\\n1363\\t1\\t595\\n1366\\t1\\t595\\n1367\\t1\\t595\\n1368\\t1\\t595\\n1382\\t1\\t595\\n1396\\t1\\t595\\n1405\\t1\\t595\\n1413\\t1\\t595\\n1445\\t1\\t595\\n1445\\t1\\t595\\n.I 596\\n.T\\nWhat Makes An Automatic Keyword Classification Effective?\\n.A\\nJones, K. Sparck\\n.A\\nBarber, E. O.\\n.W\\n   Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval\\npurposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic\\nexperiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions\\nhave been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic\\nkeyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications\\nshould have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we\\nshowed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this\\npaper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of\\nclassification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms\\nof classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval \\nsituations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in \\nperformance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that\\ndefinite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification\\nfor collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping\\nis confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the \\nclassification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing\\nterms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword\\nfrequency..\\n.X\\n51\\t1\\t596\\n57\\t1\\t596\\n63\\t1\\t596\\n69\\t1\\t596\\n71\\t1\\t596\\n75\\t1\\t596\\n77\\t1\\t596\\n79\\t1\\t596\\n161\\t1\\t596\\n168\\t1\\t596\\n175\\t3\\t596\\n176\\t4\\t596\\n197\\t1\\t596\\n315\\t1\\t596\\n329\\t1\\t596\\n348\\t1\\t596\\n375\\t1\\t596\\n382\\t1\\t596\\n389\\t1\\t596\\n390\\t1\\t596\\n445\\t1\\t596\\n448\\t1\\t596\\n454\\t1\\t596\\n472\\t1\\t596\\n480\\t1\\t596\\n483\\t1\\t596\\n484\\t1\\t596\\n486\\t1\\t596\\n487\\t1\\t596\\n488\\t2\\t596\\n491\\t1\\t596\\n493\\t1\\t596\\n502\\t1\\t596\\n503\\t2\\t596\\n506\\t1\\t596\\n507\\t2\\t596\\n509\\t2\\t596\\n510\\t1\\t596\\n512\\t1\\t596\\n517\\t1\\t596\\n520\\t1\\t596\\n522\\t1\\t596\\n527\\t1\\t596\\n528\\t1\\t596\\n531\\t1\\t596\\n554\\t1\\t596\\n565\\t2\\t596\\n566\\t1\\t596\\n570\\t1\\t596\\n572\\t1\\t596\\n579\\t2\\t596\\n581\\t1\\t596\\n591\\t1\\t596\\n593\\t1\\t596\\n594\\t1\\t596\\n595\\t2\\t596\\n596\\t6\\t596\\n597\\t1\\t596\\n599\\t1\\t596\\n600\\t2\\t596\\n601\\t1\\t596\\n603\\t2\\t596\\n604\\t1\\t596\\n606\\t1\\t596\\n608\\t2\\t596\\n619\\t1\\t596\\n633\\t1\\t596\\n659\\t1\\t596\\n715\\t1\\t596\\n723\\t1\\t596\\n724\\t1\\t596\\n754\\t1\\t596\\n790\\t1\\t596\\n799\\t1\\t596\\n801\\t1\\t596\\n805\\t3\\t596\\n806\\t1\\t596\\n807\\t1\\t596\\n809\\t1\\t596\\n810\\t2\\t596\\n812\\t2\\t596\\n813\\t2\\t596\\n814\\t2\\t596\\n817\\t1\\t596\\n824\\t1\\t596\\n825\\t1\\t596\\n836\\t1\\t596\\n863\\t1\\t596\\n864\\t1\\t596\\n866\\t1\\t596\\n867\\t1\\t596\\n870\\t1\\t596\\n894\\t2\\t596\\n928\\t1\\t596\\n956\\t2\\t596\\n963\\t2\\t596\\n987\\t1\\t596\\n988\\t1\\t596\\n989\\t2\\t596\\n990\\t1\\t596\\n991\\t1\\t596\\n1051\\t1\\t596\\n1152\\t1\\t596\\n1255\\t1\\t596\\n1265\\t1\\t596\\n1294\\t2\\t596\\n1298\\t1\\t596\\n1299\\t1\\t596\\n1327\\t3\\t596\\n1405\\t1\\t596\\n1413\\t1\\t596\\n1419\\t1\\t596\\n1427\\t1\\t596\\n1445\\t1\\t596\\n1445\\t1\\t596\\n.I 597\\n.T\\nMachine-Assisted Approach to General Reference Materials\\n.A\\nMeredith, J.

Other\\ncompound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, \\nwhile some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..\\n   These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from\\nearlier studies - especially that of the \\'force\\' required to fracture a\\nterm, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been\\nemployed at the National Rubber Producers\\' Research Association (NRPRA)\\nfor over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have\\nenabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..\\n   It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the\\napplication of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinate\\nbasis..\\n.X\\n63\\t1\\t600\\n160\\t1\\t600\\n161\\t1\\t600\\n175\\t2\\t600\\n197\\t1\\t600\\n348\\t1\\t600\\n375\\t1\\t600\\n389\\t1\\t600\\n390\\t1\\t600\\n445\\t1\\t600\\n454\\t1\\t600\\n472\\t1\\t600\\n477\\t1\\t600\\n487\\t1\\t600\\n502\\t1\\t600\\n503\\t1\\t600\\n506\\t1\\t600\\n507\\t1\\t600\\n554\\t1\\t600\\n558\\t2\\t600\\n579\\t2\\t600\\n591\\t1\\t600\\n593\\t1\\t600\\n594\\t1\\t600\\n595\\t1\\t600\\n596\\t2\\t600\\n597\\t1\\t600\\n599\\t1\\t600\\n600\\t5\\t600\\n601\\t1\\t600\\n603\\t1\\t600\\n604\\t1\\t600\\n606\\t1\\t600\\n653\\t2\\t600\\n723\\t1\\t600\\n724\\t1\\t600\\n746\\t1\\t600\\n781\\t1\\t600\\n799\\t1\\t600\\n801\\t1\\t600\\n805\\t2\\t600\\n806\\t1\\t600\\n807\\t1\\t600\\n836\\t1\\t600\\n863\\t1\\t600\\n864\\t1\\t600\\n866\\t1\\t600\\n867\\t1\\t600\\n901\\t1\\t600\\n956\\t2\\t600\\n963\\t1\\t600\\n987\\t1\\t600\\n988\\t1\\t600\\n989\\t2\\t600\\n1152\\t1\\t600\\n1265\\t1\\t600\\n1294\\t1\\t600\\n1298\\t1\\t600\\n1299\\t1\\t600\\n1327\\t2\\t600\\n1394\\t1\\t600\\n1405\\t1\\t600\\n1414\\t1\\t600\\n1422\\t1\\t600\\n1422\\t1\\t600\\n.I 601\\n.T\\nSome Implications of Automatic Recognition of Bibliographic Elements\\n.A\\nShoffner, Ralph M.\\n.W\\n   A theoretical approach to the problem of converting printed bibliographic \\nrecords to machine readable form is developed based on principles of system \\nanalysis..

With this technique the\\ngreater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The\\ntitle-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These \\nqueries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared\\nwith the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with \\nfixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 \\nrelevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the \\nrelative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the \\nchoice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t603\\n34\\t2\\t603\\n38\\t3\\t603\\n49\\t1\\t603\\n51\\t1\\t603\\n52\\t2\\t603\\n53\\t1\\t603\\n59\\t1\\t603\\n69\\t1\\t603\\n71\\t1\\t603\\n77\\t1\\t603\\n79\\t1\\t603\\n91\\t1\\t603\\n124\\t1\\t603\\n127\\t1\\t603\\n129\\t1\\t603\\n150\\t3\\t603\\n161\\t1\\t603\\n164\\t1\\t603\\n168\\t1\\t603\\n175\\t2\\t603\\n176\\t1\\t603\\n190\\t1\\t603\\n191\\t1\\t603\\n197\\t2\\t603\\n202\\t1\\t603\\n211\\t1\\t603\\n213\\t1\\t603\\n214\\t1\\t603\\n218\\t1\\t603\\n224\\t2\\t603\\n243\\t2\\t603\\n298\\t1\\t603\\n307\\t1\\t603\\n315\\t1\\t603\\n330\\t1\\t603\\n375\\t1\\t603\\n378\\t1\\t603\\n381\\t1\\t603\\n382\\t1\\t603\\n421\\t1\\t603\\n429\\t2\\t603\\n445\\t1\\t603\\n448\\t1\\t603\\n450\\t1\\t603\\n451\\t1\\t603\\n452\\t1\\t603\\n454\\t1\\t603\\n456\\t1\\t603\\n458\\t1\\t603\\n459\\t1\\t603\\n465\\t1\\t603\\n466\\t1\\t603\\n468\\t1\\t603\\n472\\t1\\t603\\n480\\t1\\t603\\n483\\t1\\t603\\n484\\t2\\t603\\n486\\t1\\t603\\n488\\t1\\t603\\n490\\t1\\t603\\n491\\t2\\t603\\n492\\t1\\t603\\n493\\t1\\t603\\n503\\t2\\t603\\n506\\t2\\t603\\n507\\t3\\t603\\n508\\t1\\t603\\n509\\t1\\t603\\n510\\t6\\t603\\n511\\t1\\t603\\n512\\t3\\t603\\n513\\t1\\t603\\n514\\t3\\t603\\n517\\t1\\t603\\n518\\t1\\t603\\n520\\t3\\t603\\n522\\t1\\t603\\n523\\t1\\t603\\n524\\t1\\t603\\n525\\t1\\t603\\n526\\t1\\t603\\n527\\t1\\t603\\n528\\t1\\t603\\n529\\t1\\t603\\n530\\t1\\t603\\n531\\t1\\t603\\n534\\t1\\t603\\n546\\t1\\t603\\n553\\t1\\t603\\n554\\t2\\t603\\n565\\t1\\t603\\n566\\t1\\t603\\n575\\t1\\t603\\n579\\t3\\t603\\n581\\t1\\t603\\n582\\t3\\t603\\n586\\t1\\t603\\n588\\t1\\t603\\n589\\t3\\t603\\n591\\t4\\t603\\n593\\t1\\t603\\n594\\t2\\t603\\n595\\t3\\t603\\n596\\t2\\t603\\n597\\t1\\t603\\n599\\t2\\t603\\n600\\t1\\t603\\n603\\t13\\t603\\n604\\t3\\t603\\n606\\t2\\t603\\n608\\t2\\t603\\n609\\t1\\t603\\n610\\t2\\t603\\n611\\t1\\t603\\n612\\t1\\t603\\n613\\t1\\t603\\n614\\t1\\t603\\n615\\t1\\t603\\n618\\t1\\t603\\n619\\t1\\t603\\n620\\t1\\t603\\n621\\t1\\t603\\n622\\t1\\t603\\n623\\t1\\t603\\n625\\t2\\t603\\n626\\t1\\t603\\n629\\t1\\t603\\n630\\t2\\t603\\n633\\t2\\t603\\n636\\t1\\t603\\n637\\t1\\t603\\n639\\t1\\t603\\n642\\t1\\t603\\n648\\t1\\t603\\n650\\t1\\t603\\n657\\t1\\t603\\n659\\t2\\t603\\n676\\t1\\t603\\n685\\t1\\t603\\n686\\t1\\t603\\n691\\t1\\t603\\n692\\t1\\t603\\n696\\t1\\t603\\n699\\t1\\t603\\n703\\t1\\t603\\n705\\t1\\t603\\n708\\t1\\t603\\n711\\t1\\t603\\n715\\t1\\t603\\n721\\t1\\t603\\n722\\t4\\t603\\n723\\t2\\t603\\n724\\t2\\t603\\n725\\t1\\t603\\n726\\t4\\t603\\n727\\t1\\t603\\n728\\t2\\t603\\n730\\t1\\t603\\n731\\t2\\t603\\n732\\t2\\t603\\n733\\t1\\t603\\n734\\t1\\t603\\n736\\t1\\t603\\n738\\t1\\t603\\n739\\t1\\t603\\n740\\t1\\t603\\n741\\t1\\t603\\n742\\t1\\t603\\n743\\t1\\t603\\n744\\t1\\t603\\n752\\t1\\t603\\n754\\t1\\t603\\n755\\t2\\t603\\n780\\t1\\t603\\n790\\t1\\t603\\n801\\t1\\t603\\n805\\t2\\t603\\n806\\t1\\t603\\n807\\t1\\t603\\n809\\t2\\t603\\n810\\t2\\t603\\n812\\t1\\t603\\n813\\t5\\t603\\n814\\t2\\t603\\n817\\t1\\t603\\n820\\t4\\t603\\n822\\t3\\t603\\n824\\t1\\t603\\n825\\t1\\t603\\n826\\t1\\t603\\n827\\t2\\t603\\n828\\t1\\t603\\n830\\t1\\t603\\n836\\t1\\t603\\n866\\t1\\t603\\n867\\t1\\t603\\n870\\t1\\t603\\n879\\t2\\t603\\n883\\t1\\t603\\n894\\t1\\t603\\n907\\t1\\t603\\n956\\t1\\t603\\n958\\t1\\t603\\n986\\t1\\t603\\n987\\t1\\t603\\n988\\t1\\t603\\n989\\t1\\t603\\n1004\\t1\\t603\\n1035\\t1\\t603\\n1051\\t1\\t603\\n1078\\t1\\t603\\n1089\\t1\\t603\\n1091\\t4\\t603\\n1144\\t1\\t603\\n1195\\t2\\t603\\n1207\\t1\\t603\\n1208\\t1\\t603\\n1264\\t1\\t603\\n1283\\t1\\t603\\n1293\\t1\\t603\\n1294\\t1\\t603\\n1297\\t1\\t603\\n1298\\t2\\t603\\n1299\\t2\\t603\\n1302\\t1\\t603\\n1303\\t1\\t603\\n1327\\t2\\t603\\n1356\\t1\\t603\\n1363\\t1\\t603\\n1364\\t1\\t603\\n1366\\t1\\t603\\n1367\\t1\\t603\\n1368\\t2\\t603\\n1370\\t1\\t603\\n1372\\t1\\t603\\n1373\\t1\\t603\\n1374\\t1\\t603\\n1375\\t1\\t603\\n1376\\t1\\t603\\n1377\\t1\\t603\\n1396\\t1\\t603\\n1405\\t1\\t603\\n1419\\t1\\t603\\n1421\\t1\\t603\\n1427\\t1\\t603\\n1448\\t3\\t603\\n1448\\t3\\t603\\n.I 604\\n.T\\nComparison of Document Data Bases\\n.A\\nSchipma, Peter B.\\n.A\\nWilliams, Martha E.\\n.A\\nShafton, Allan L.\\n.W\\n   This paper presents a detailed analysis of the content and format of seven\\nmachine-readable bibliographic data bases: Chemical Abstract Service \\nCondensates, Chemical and Biological Activities, and Polymer Science and\\nTechnology, Biosciences Information Service\\'s BA Previews including Biological\\nAbstracts and BioReseach Index, Institute for Science Information Source Tape, \\nand Engineering Index COMPENDEX..\\n   Selected issue test tapes of each data base were printed and checked for the\\ntypes of data that were contained in the issue and the methods in which the \\ndata were formatted..

Consequently, the\\nprocess of query formulation by the user, interactively with the\\ninformation available in te system, remains one of the principal\\nproblems in information retrieval today..\\n   In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface\\ncommunication between man and the computer, we have pursued the\\nobjective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT\\nin a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a\\nlight pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using\\nhis passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction\\nvocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a \\nhierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be\\naugmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to\\nthe user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to\\nreplicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, \\nthus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man\\'s problem\\ninto the structure and vocabulary of the system..\\n.X\\n61\\t1\\t606\\n66\\t1\\t606\\n74\\t1\\t606\\n75\\t1\\t606\\n124\\t1\\t606\\n127\\t1\\t606\\n129\\t1\\t606\\n161\\t1\\t606\\n190\\t1\\t606\\n191\\t1\\t606\\n197\\t3\\t606\\n211\\t1\\t606\\n214\\t1\\t606\\n218\\t2\\t606\\n243\\t1\\t606\\n274\\t1\\t606\\n307\\t1\\t606\\n320\\t1\\t606\\n330\\t1\\t606\\n332\\t2\\t606\\n343\\t1\\t606\\n375\\t1\\t606\\n378\\t1\\t606\\n417\\t1\\t606\\n445\\t1\\t606\\n450\\t1\\t606\\n451\\t2\\t606\\n452\\t1\\t606\\n454\\t1\\t606\\n458\\t2\\t606\\n459\\t2\\t606\\n460\\t1\\t606\\n468\\t1\\t606\\n472\\t1\\t606\\n484\\t2\\t606\\n492\\t1\\t606\\n503\\t1\\t606\\n506\\t1\\t606\\n507\\t1\\t606\\n508\\t2\\t606\\n511\\t1\\t606\\n512\\t1\\t606\\n514\\t2\\t606\\n518\\t1\\t606\\n520\\t1\\t606\\n523\\t3\\t606\\n524\\t1\\t606\\n525\\t1\\t606\\n526\\t4\\t606\\n528\\t1\\t606\\n529\\t1\\t606\\n530\\t1\\t606\\n534\\t2\\t606\\n546\\t6\\t606\\n547\\t1\\t606\\n553\\t1\\t606\\n554\\t1\\t606\\n579\\t4\\t606\\n584\\t1\\t606\\n591\\t2\\t606\\n593\\t2\\t606\\n594\\t6\\t606\\n595\\t1\\t606\\n596\\t1\\t606\\n597\\t1\\t606\\n599\\t1\\t606\\n600\\t1\\t606\\n603\\t2\\t606\\n604\\t2\\t606\\n606\\t12\\t606\\n609\\t2\\t606\\n610\\t2\\t606\\n611\\t2\\t606\\n612\\t3\\t606\\n619\\t1\\t606\\n625\\t1\\t606\\n626\\t4\\t606\\n630\\t1\\t606\\n636\\t1\\t606\\n637\\t3\\t606\\n641\\t1\\t606\\n642\\t2\\t606\\n648\\t1\\t606\\n650\\t1\\t606\\n692\\t1\\t606\\n696\\t1\\t606\\n699\\t1\\t606\\n703\\t1\\t606\\n705\\t1\\t606\\n708\\t1\\t606\\n723\\t1\\t606\\n724\\t1\\t606\\n726\\t1\\t606\\n727\\t1\\t606\\n728\\t1\\t606\\n731\\t1\\t606\\n732\\t1\\t606\\n733\\t2\\t606\\n734\\t1\\t606\\n736\\t1\\t606\\n738\\t1\\t606\\n739\\t1\\t606\\n740\\t1\\t606\\n741\\t1\\t606\\n742\\t1\\t606\\n743\\t1\\t606\\n744\\t1\\t606\\n754\\t1\\t606\\n755\\t1\\t606\\n801\\t1\\t606\\n805\\t1\\t606\\n806\\t1\\t606\\n814\\t1\\t606\\n820\\t1\\t606\\n826\\t3\\t606\\n827\\t1\\t606\\n830\\t1\\t606\\n836\\t1\\t606\\n866\\t1\\t606\\n867\\t1\\t606\\n879\\t1\\t606\\n883\\t1\\t606\\n956\\t1\\t606\\n989\\t1\\t606\\n1004\\t1\\t606\\n1035\\t3\\t606\\n1078\\t1\\t606\\n1089\\t1\\t606\\n1091\\t1\\t606\\n1207\\t1\\t606\\n1264\\t1\\t606\\n1297\\t1\\t606\\n1298\\t1\\t606\\n1299\\t1\\t606\\n1303\\t2\\t606\\n1327\\t1\\t606\\n1356\\t1\\t606\\n1364\\t1\\t606\\n1368\\t1\\t606\\n1370\\t1\\t606\\n1372\\t1\\t606\\n1373\\t1\\t606\\n1374\\t2\\t606\\n1375\\t1\\t606\\n1376\\t1\\t606\\n1377\\t2\\t606\\n1387\\t1\\t606\\n1405\\t1\\t606\\n1427\\t1\\t606\\n1427\\t1\\t606\\n.I 607\\n.T\\nImproving a Field-based \"Eric-Like\" Information System\\n.A\\nPaisley, W.\\n.W\\n  This is a period for rapid growth in information systems\\nfor the sciences and professions.

Finally, the incorporation of user \\nfeedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS \\noutput of 15 to 30 percent.. \\n   One concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining \\ncontrolled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments..\\n.X\\n38\\t1\\t608\\n51\\t1\\t608\\n57\\t1\\t608\\n69\\t1\\t608\\n71\\t1\\t608\\n72\\t1\\t608\\n75\\t2\\t608\\n77\\t1\\t608\\n79\\t2\\t608\\n86\\t1\\t608\\n90\\t1\\t608\\n149\\t1\\t608\\n168\\t2\\t608\\n175\\t3\\t608\\n176\\t2\\t608\\n231\\t1\\t608\\n261\\t1\\t608\\n295\\t1\\t608\\n299\\t1\\t608\\n315\\t1\\t608\\n317\\t1\\t608\\n329\\t1\\t608\\n332\\t1\\t608\\n334\\t1\\t608\\n354\\t1\\t608\\n361\\t1\\t608\\n382\\t5\\t608\\n389\\t1\\t608\\n390\\t1\\t608\\n417\\t1\\t608\\n443\\t1\\t608\\n448\\t1\\t608\\n480\\t1\\t608\\n483\\t1\\t608\\n484\\t1\\t608\\n486\\t1\\t608\\n488\\t1\\t608\\n491\\t1\\t608\\n493\\t1\\t608\\n503\\t1\\t608\\n507\\t1\\t608\\n509\\t1\\t608\\n510\\t1\\t608\\n512\\t1\\t608\\n514\\t1\\t608\\n517\\t1\\t608\\n520\\t2\\t608\\n522\\t1\\t608\\n527\\t1\\t608\\n528\\t1\\t608\\n531\\t1\\t608\\n546\\t1\\t608\\n554\\t1\\t608\\n565\\t3\\t608\\n566\\t1\\t608\\n570\\t1\\t608\\n572\\t2\\t608\\n576\\t1\\t608\\n581\\t1\\t608\\n583\\t1\\t608\\n586\\t3\\t608\\n591\\t1\\t608\\n595\\t1\\t608\\n596\\t2\\t608\\n603\\t2\\t608\\n608\\t11\\t608\\n610\\t2\\t608\\n617\\t1\\t608\\n619\\t1\\t608\\n620\\t1\\t608\\n633\\t1\\t608\\n636\\t1\\t608\\n643\\t1\\t608\\n659\\t2\\t608\\n715\\t1\\t608\\n754\\t1\\t608\\n762\\t1\\t608\\n790\\t1\\t608\\n805\\t1\\t608\\n809\\t1\\t608\\n810\\t2\\t608\\n812\\t2\\t608\\n813\\t2\\t608\\n814\\t2\\t608\\n815\\t1\\t608\\n817\\t1\\t608\\n820\\t1\\t608\\n824\\t1\\t608\\n825\\t2\\t608\\n870\\t1\\t608\\n894\\t3\\t608\\n902\\t1\\t608\\n928\\t1\\t608\\n938\\t1\\t608\\n939\\t1\\t608\\n956\\t1\\t608\\n961\\t1\\t608\\n963\\t1\\t608\\n966\\t1\\t608\\n986\\t1\\t608\\n990\\t1\\t608\\n991\\t2\\t608\\n992\\t1\\t608\\n997\\t1\\t608\\n1046\\t1\\t608\\n1051\\t1\\t608\\n1144\\t1\\t608\\n1216\\t1\\t608\\n1221\\t1\\t608\\n1255\\t1\\t608\\n1266\\t1\\t608\\n1294\\t3\\t608\\n1313\\t1\\t608\\n1318\\t1\\t608\\n1327\\t4\\t608\\n1365\\t1\\t608\\n1390\\t1\\t608\\n1395\\t1\\t608\\n1399\\t1\\t608\\n1413\\t1\\t608\\n1419\\t2\\t608\\n1421\\t1\\t608\\n1427\\t1\\t608\\n1445\\t1\\t608\\n1445\\t1\\t608\\n.I 609\\n.T\\nReport on the Evaluation of an Experimental Computer-Based \\nCurrent-Awareness Service for Chemists\\n.A\\nBarker, Frances H.\\n.A\\nWyatt, Barry K.\\n.A\\nVeal, Douglas C.\\n.W\\n   A selected sample of U.K. University, industrial and Government scientists\\nwere given a current-awareness service for 18 months, in order to investigate\\nthe practicability and problems of such a service..

Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on\\nwhich a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..\\nTo interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the\\ndevelopment of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more\\nindependent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify\\nthose clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented\\nreference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..\\n   Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference\\nretrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same\\n19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor \\nanalyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was \\nlabeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the total\\nvariance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over \\n17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accounted\\nfor over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor\\nstructure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three\\ndimensional structure underlies users\\' attitudes toward a more general\\nclass of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system\\nevaluation of users\\' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..\\n   In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective\\nscales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..\\nBrief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..\\nThe discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure\\nand the need for a predicative replication of the study..     \\n.X\\n90\\t1\\t610\\n124\\t3\\t610\\n125\\t1\\t610\\n127\\t1\\t610\\n129\\t1\\t610\\n165\\t1\\t610\\n190\\t1\\t610\\n191\\t1\\t610\\n197\\t1\\t610\\n211\\t1\\t610\\n214\\t1\\t610\\n218\\t1\\t610\\n231\\t1\\t610\\n243\\t1\\t610\\n261\\t1\\t610\\n295\\t1\\t610\\n299\\t1\\t610\\n307\\t1\\t610\\n330\\t1\\t610\\n334\\t1\\t610\\n343\\t1\\t610\\n354\\t1\\t610\\n378\\t1\\t610\\n381\\t1\\t610\\n417\\t1\\t610\\n448\\t1\\t610\\n450\\t1\\t610\\n451\\t1\\t610\\n452\\t2\\t610\\n459\\t1\\t610\\n468\\t1\\t610\\n484\\t2\\t610\\n492\\t1\\t610\\n508\\t1\\t610\\n511\\t2\\t610\\n512\\t1\\t610\\n514\\t2\\t610\\n516\\t1\\t610\\n518\\t2\\t610\\n520\\t1\\t610\\n521\\t1\\t610\\n522\\t1\\t610\\n523\\t2\\t610\\n524\\t1\\t610\\n525\\t1\\t610\\n526\\t2\\t610\\n527\\t1\\t610\\n528\\t1\\t610\\n529\\t2\\t610\\n530\\t1\\t610\\n534\\t1\\t610\\n546\\t2\\t610\\n553\\t1\\t610\\n575\\t1\\t610\\n579\\t1\\t610\\n586\\t1\\t610\\n591\\t1\\t610\\n594\\t1\\t610\\n597\\t1\\t610\\n603\\t2\\t610\\n604\\t1\\t610\\n606\\t2\\t610\\n608\\t2\\t610\\n609\\t1\\t610\\n610\\t9\\t610\\n611\\t2\\t610\\n612\\t3\\t610\\n615\\t1\\t610\\n617\\t1\\t610\\n620\\t1\\t610\\n625\\t2\\t610\\n626\\t3\\t610\\n630\\t1\\t610\\n636\\t2\\t610\\n637\\t1\\t610\\n642\\t1\\t610\\n648\\t1\\t610\\n650\\t1\\t610\\n692\\t1\\t610\\n696\\t1\\t610\\n699\\t1\\t610\\n700\\t1\\t610\\n703\\t1\\t610\\n705\\t2\\t610\\n707\\t1\\t610\\n708\\t1\\t610\\n726\\t1\\t610\\n727\\t2\\t610\\n728\\t1\\t610\\n731\\t1\\t610\\n732\\t1\\t610\\n733\\t1\\t610\\n734\\t1\\t610\\n736\\t1\\t610\\n738\\t1\\t610\\n739\\t1\\t610\\n740\\t1\\t610\\n741\\t1\\t610\\n742\\t1\\t610\\n743\\t1\\t610\\n744\\t1\\t610\\n754\\t1\\t610\\n755\\t1\\t610\\n812\\t1\\t610\\n815\\t1\\t610\\n817\\t1\\t610\\n820\\t1\\t610\\n824\\t1\\t610\\n826\\t1\\t610\\n827\\t1\\t610\\n875\\t1\\t610\\n879\\t1\\t610\\n883\\t1\\t610\\n938\\t1\\t610\\n939\\t1\\t610\\n986\\t1\\t610\\n991\\t1\\t610\\n992\\t1\\t610\\n1004\\t1\\t610\\n1035\\t1\\t610\\n1047\\t1\\t610\\n1078\\t1\\t610\\n1089\\t1\\t610\\n1091\\t1\\t610\\n1207\\t1\\t610\\n1221\\t1\\t610\\n1264\\t1\\t610\\n1297\\t1\\t610\\n1303\\t3\\t610\\n1318\\t1\\t610\\n1327\\t1\\t610\\n1356\\t1\\t610\\n1364\\t2\\t610\\n1365\\t1\\t610\\n1366\\t1\\t610\\n1367\\t1\\t610\\n1368\\t2\\t610\\n1370\\t1\\t610\\n1372\\t1\\t610\\n1373\\t1\\t610\\n1374\\t1\\t610\\n1375\\t1\\t610\\n1376\\t1\\t610\\n1377\\t1\\t610\\n1387\\t1\\t610\\n1390\\t1\\t610\\n1390\\t1\\t610\\n.I 611\\n.T\\nWhat Information Dissemination Studies Imply Concerning the Design of\\nOn-Line Reference Retrieval Systems*\\n.A\\nBack, Harry B.\\n.W\\n   The use of an on-line computer system for locating bibliographic citations\\nhas been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the \"information\\nexplosion..\" However, on-line reference retrieval is only one element in a\\nlarge social system of information dissemination.. To have a widespread impact,\\nan on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources\\nof references.. This paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a\\nbasis for determining how on-line retrieval can best compete.  It recommends\\nthe functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the\\nforms of written media that should be included in the system\\'s initial data\\nbase.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely\\nused and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods..\\n.X\\n124\\t2\\t611\\n125\\t1\\t611\\n127\\t1\\t611\\n129\\t1\\t611\\n190\\t1\\t611\\n191\\t1\\t611\\n197\\t1\\t611\\n211\\t1\\t611\\n214\\t1\\t611\\n218\\t1\\t611\\n243\\t1\\t611\\n307\\t2\\t611\\n330\\t1\\t611\\n343\\t1\\t611\\n357\\t1\\t611\\n378\\t1\\t611\\n417\\t1\\t611\\n450\\t1\\t611\\n451\\t1\\t611\\n452\\t1\\t611\\n459\\t2\\t611\\n468\\t1\\t611\\n484\\t1\\t611\\n492\\t1\\t611\\n508\\t1\\t611\\n511\\t1\\t611\\n512\\t1\\t611\\n514\\t3\\t611\\n518\\t1\\t611\\n520\\t1\\t611\\n523\\t1\\t611\\n524\\t1\\t611\\n525\\t1\\t611\\n526\\t1\\t611\\n529\\t1\\t611\\n530\\t1\\t611\\n532\\t1\\t611\\n533\\t1\\t611\\n534\\t1\\t611\\n546\\t2\\t611\\n553\\t1\\t611\\n579\\t1\\t611\\n594\\t2\\t611\\n603\\t1\\t611\\n604\\t2\\t611\\n606\\t2\\t611\\n609\\t1\\t611\\n610\\t2\\t611\\n611\\t5\\t611\\n612\\t3\\t611\\n625\\t1\\t611\\n626\\t2\\t611\\n630\\t1\\t611\\n636\\t1\\t611\\n637\\t1\\t611\\n642\\t1\\t611\\n648\\t1\\t611\\n650\\t1\\t611\\n692\\t1\\t611\\n696\\t1\\t611\\n699\\t1\\t611\\n703\\t1\\t611\\n705\\t1\\t611\\n708\\t1\\t611\\n726\\t1\\t611\\n727\\t1\\t611\\n728\\t2\\t611\\n731\\t1\\t611\\n732\\t1\\t611\\n733\\t2\\t611\\n734\\t1\\t611\\n736\\t1\\t611\\n738\\t1\\t611\\n739\\t1\\t611\\n740\\t2\\t611\\n741\\t1\\t611\\n742\\t1\\t611\\n743\\t2\\t611\\n744\\t1\\t611\\n755\\t1\\t611\\n820\\t1\\t611\\n826\\t1\\t611\\n827\\t1\\t611\\n879\\t2\\t611\\n883\\t1\\t611\\n1004\\t1\\t611\\n1035\\t1\\t611\\n1078\\t1\\t611\\n1089\\t1\\t611\\n1091\\t1\\t611\\n1207\\t1\\t611\\n1264\\t1\\t611\\n1297\\t1\\t611\\n1303\\t2\\t611\\n1356\\t1\\t611\\n1364\\t1\\t611\\n1368\\t1\\t611\\n1370\\t1\\t611\\n1372\\t1\\t611\\n1373\\t1\\t611\\n1374\\t2\\t611\\n1375\\t1\\t611\\n1376\\t2\\t611\\n1377\\t1\\t611\\n1387\\t1\\t611\\n1396\\t1\\t611\\n1396\\t1\\t611\\n.I 612\\n.T\\nInteractive Search of Bibliographic Data Bases in an Academic Environment\\n.A\\nBorman, Lorraine\\n.A\\nMittman, Benjamin\\n.W\\n   A surprising difference is found in the acceptance of on-line bibliographic \\nsearch between university research workers and students in the classroom..

As previously shown, \\none-third of the 5,860 papers from the National Heart Institute grantees for\\n1967 appeared within 13 journals (3).. After the exclusion of the abstract\\njournals, the remaining journals were used to obtain a basic pool of 300\\ncardiovascular related articles.. Science Citation Index was used to\\ngather statistics relative to citing author, journal and year.. The 300\\narticles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during this\\nfour-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate by\\nyear serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak during\\nthe third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citation\\nwere noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author, \\n15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basic \\njournals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of the\\ncitations were found in these journals.. Although the citations were\\nfound throughout 349 journals, indicating an extensive scatter, a\\nrelatively high percentage of papers were found in few journals..\\n.X\\n33\\t2\\t613\\n36\\t2\\t613\\n41\\t1\\t613\\n89\\t1\\t613\\n90\\t1\\t613\\n91\\t1\\t613\\n97\\t1\\t613\\n102\\t1\\t613\\n111\\t1\\t613\\n112\\t1\\t613\\n161\\t1\\t613\\n163\\t1\\t613\\n183\\t2\\t613\\n184\\t2\\t613\\n193\\t2\\t613\\n199\\t2\\t613\\n201\\t1\\t613\\n202\\t1\\t613\\n203\\t2\\t613\\n204\\t1\\t613\\n205\\t1\\t613\\n209\\t1\\t613\\n210\\t1\\t613\\n212\\t1\\t613\\n217\\t1\\t613\\n220\\t1\\t613\\n222\\t1\\t613\\n225\\t1\\t613\\n269\\t1\\t613\\n284\\t1\\t613\\n286\\t1\\t613\\n294\\t1\\t613\\n373\\t1\\t613\\n377\\t1\\t613\\n429\\t1\\t613\\n513\\t1\\t613\\n543\\t1\\t613\\n545\\t1\\t613\\n552\\t1\\t613\\n582\\t1\\t613\\n587\\t1\\t613\\n588\\t3\\t613\\n589\\t1\\t613\\n603\\t1\\t613\\n605\\t2\\t613\\n613\\t6\\t613\\n614\\t2\\t613\\n618\\t1\\t613\\n624\\t1\\t613\\n638\\t1\\t613\\n657\\t1\\t613\\n685\\t1\\t613\\n686\\t1\\t613\\n691\\t1\\t613\\n721\\t1\\t613\\n722\\t1\\t613\\n724\\t1\\t613\\n725\\t1\\t613\\n735\\t1\\t613\\n747\\t1\\t613\\n750\\t1\\t613\\n753\\t1\\t613\\n766\\t1\\t613\\n767\\t1\\t613\\n770\\t1\\t613\\n775\\t1\\t613\\n776\\t1\\t613\\n782\\t1\\t613\\n784\\t1\\t613\\n788\\t1\\t613\\n789\\t1\\t613\\n793\\t1\\t613\\n799\\t1\\t613\\n800\\t2\\t613\\n808\\t2\\t613\\n905\\t1\\t613\\n953\\t1\\t613\\n958\\t1\\t613\\n959\\t1\\t613\\n977\\t1\\t613\\n983\\t1\\t613\\n987\\t1\\t613\\n988\\t1\\t613\\n1016\\t1\\t613\\n1023\\t1\\t613\\n1030\\t1\\t613\\n1055\\t1\\t613\\n1087\\t2\\t613\\n1090\\t1\\t613\\n1135\\t1\\t613\\n1151\\t1\\t613\\n1208\\t1\\t613\\n1260\\t1\\t613\\n1275\\t1\\t613\\n1276\\t1\\t613\\n1278\\t1\\t613\\n1280\\t1\\t613\\n1285\\t1\\t613\\n1286\\t1\\t613\\n1287\\t1\\t613\\n1293\\t1\\t613\\n1302\\t3\\t613\\n1335\\t1\\t613\\n1390\\t1\\t613\\n1397\\t1\\t613\\n1417\\t1\\t613\\n1428\\t1\\t613\\n1432\\t1\\t613\\n1432\\t1\\t613\\n.I 614\\n.T\\nThe Use Patterns of Physics Journals in a Large Academic Research Library\\n.A\\nChen, Ching-Chih\\n.W\\n   The purpose of this investigation was to reveal the use of patterns of the\\nphysics journals in the M.I.T.

Through \\nthe use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparative\\nevaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides the\\ncosts of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..\\nIn addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance\\nlevel of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is\\nexpended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost of\\noperating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance level\\nand for a given cost per unit of user and system time..\\n.X\\n5\\t1\\t615\\n28\\t1\\t615\\n90\\t1\\t615\\n91\\t1\\t615\\n124\\t1\\t615\\n125\\t1\\t615\\n157\\t1\\t615\\n158\\t1\\t615\\n165\\t1\\t615\\n172\\t1\\t615\\n175\\t1\\t615\\n191\\t1\\t615\\n194\\t1\\t615\\n212\\t1\\t615\\n222\\t1\\t615\\n223\\t1\\t615\\n224\\t1\\t615\\n274\\t1\\t615\\n298\\t1\\t615\\n368\\t1\\t615\\n381\\t3\\t615\\n389\\t1\\t615\\n417\\t1\\t615\\n435\\t1\\t615\\n446\\t1\\t615\\n448\\t1\\t615\\n452\\t1\\t615\\n456\\t1\\t615\\n458\\t2\\t615\\n468\\t1\\t615\\n484\\t1\\t615\\n485\\t1\\t615\\n511\\t1\\t615\\n514\\t2\\t615\\n516\\t1\\t615\\n518\\t2\\t615\\n521\\t1\\t615\\n522\\t1\\t615\\n523\\t1\\t615\\n526\\t1\\t615\\n527\\t1\\t615\\n528\\t1\\t615\\n529\\t1\\t615\\n554\\t1\\t615\\n572\\t1\\t615\\n575\\t2\\t615\\n577\\t1\\t615\\n579\\t2\\t615\\n591\\t1\\t615\\n595\\t2\\t615\\n599\\t1\\t615\\n603\\t1\\t615\\n610\\t1\\t615\\n615\\t5\\t615\\n619\\t1\\t615\\n620\\t1\\t615\\n621\\t1\\t615\\n625\\t2\\t615\\n626\\t1\\t615\\n630\\t1\\t615\\n636\\t1\\t615\\n640\\t1\\t615\\n646\\t1\\t615\\n700\\t1\\t615\\n705\\t1\\t615\\n707\\t1\\t615\\n727\\t1\\t615\\n752\\t2\\t615\\n754\\t1\\t615\\n780\\t1\\t615\\n785\\t1\\t615\\n812\\t1\\t615\\n815\\t1\\t615\\n817\\t1\\t615\\n820\\t1\\t615\\n822\\t2\\t615\\n824\\t1\\t615\\n827\\t1\\t615\\n829\\t1\\t615\\n875\\t1\\t615\\n895\\t1\\t615\\n902\\t1\\t615\\n907\\t1\\t615\\n957\\t1\\t615\\n1023\\t1\\t615\\n1033\\t1\\t615\\n1084\\t1\\t615\\n1091\\t1\\t615\\n1219\\t1\\t615\\n1227\\t1\\t615\\n1279\\t1\\t615\\n1282\\t1\\t615\\n1303\\t1\\t615\\n1327\\t1\\t615\\n1364\\t1\\t615\\n1365\\t1\\t615\\n1366\\t1\\t615\\n1367\\t1\\t615\\n1368\\t1\\t615\\n1387\\t1\\t615\\n1390\\t1\\t615\\n1390\\t1\\t615\\n.I 616\\n.T\\nA Bibliometric Analysis of Certain Information Science Literature\\n.A\\nDonohue, Joseph C.\\n.W\\n   Several bibliometric techniques previously applied to \\nseparate scientific literatures were used together in the analysis of a\\nsingle corpus of journal articles relating to information science.. \\nTechniques included are (a) Bradford analysis, (b) epidemic analysis, \\n(c) identification of research front, and (d) bibliographic coupling.. \\nSimilar analysis was made of writings cited by the main corpus articles, \\nand of the literature which in turn cites the main corpus..

The system, operational since January,\\n1971, has evolved from a former batch card system and remains completely\\ncompatible with it.. The system allows real-time display and updating of\\nall elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claims\\noperations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplished\\non a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is an\\nIBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applications\\nprograms, and IBM 2260 display units..\\n   This article is the first of three.. The second is concerned with an\\nanalysis of inverted file retrieval features and the third compares the\\noperation of the on-line with the batch system, comparable manual operations,\\nand discusses costs..\\n.X\\n90\\t2\\t617\\n200\\t1\\t617\\n231\\t1\\t617\\n261\\t1\\t617\\n289\\t1\\t617\\n294\\t1\\t617\\n295\\t1\\t617\\n299\\t1\\t617\\n334\\t1\\t617\\n354\\t1\\t617\\n553\\t1\\t617\\n608\\t1\\t617\\n610\\t1\\t617\\n612\\t1\\t617\\n617\\t6\\t617\\n620\\t5\\t617\\n815\\t1\\t617\\n872\\t1\\t617\\n938\\t1\\t617\\n939\\t1\\t617\\n963\\t1\\t617\\n990\\t1\\t617\\n991\\t1\\t617\\n992\\t1\\t617\\n1221\\t2\\t617\\n1229\\t1\\t617\\n1318\\t1\\t617\\n1365\\t1\\t617\\n1390\\t1\\t617\\n1390\\t1\\t617\\n.I 618\\n.T\\nInterrelationships of Scientific Journals\\n.A\\nNarin, Francis\\nCarpenter, Mark\\nBerlt, Nancy C.\\n.W\\n   A series of models of the interrelationship of scientific journals\\nhas been developed from the cross citing amongst 275 journals in\\nmathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology..    \\nThe data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived\\nfrom the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal by\\njournal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index..\\nA large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics\\nof the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear\\nboundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary\\njournals as cross field information links..\\nThe separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderly\\nmanner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry -->\\nbiochemistry --> biology..

The more plausible the simplifying\\nassumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure..\\nThis, along with evidence gleaned from \\'validation experiments\\' of a certain\\nkind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure\\nof effectiveness to use under given test conditions..\\n.X\\n9\\t1\\t625\\n15\\t1\\t625\\n29\\t1\\t625\\n35\\t1\\t625\\n42\\t1\\t625\\n43\\t1\\t625\\n54\\t1\\t625\\n57\\t1\\t625\\n58\\t1\\t625\\n70\\t1\\t625\\n73\\t2\\t625\\n84\\t1\\t625\\n124\\t2\\t625\\n125\\t1\\t625\\n127\\t1\\t625\\n129\\t1\\t625\\n152\\t1\\t625\\n165\\t1\\t625\\n167\\t1\\t625\\n175\\t2\\t625\\n190\\t2\\t625\\n191\\t1\\t625\\n197\\t1\\t625\\n207\\t1\\t625\\n211\\t1\\t625\\n214\\t1\\t625\\n218\\t1\\t625\\n222\\t1\\t625\\n223\\t1\\t625\\n224\\t1\\t625\\n243\\t1\\t625\\n274\\t2\\t625\\n296\\t1\\t625\\n297\\t1\\t625\\n298\\t2\\t625\\n300\\t1\\t625\\n301\\t1\\t625\\n302\\t1\\t625\\n307\\t1\\t625\\n313\\t1\\t625\\n319\\t1\\t625\\n330\\t1\\t625\\n358\\t1\\t625\\n359\\t1\\t625\\n364\\t1\\t625\\n378\\t1\\t625\\n381\\t2\\t625\\n382\\t1\\t625\\n390\\t1\\t625\\n444\\t1\\t625\\n445\\t3\\t625\\n447\\t2\\t625\\n448\\t1\\t625\\n449\\t3\\t625\\n450\\t1\\t625\\n451\\t1\\t625\\n452\\t2\\t625\\n456\\t1\\t625\\n458\\t1\\t625\\n459\\t3\\t625\\n468\\t2\\t625\\n474\\t1\\t625\\n484\\t2\\t625\\n486\\t1\\t625\\n492\\t1\\t625\\n508\\t1\\t625\\n509\\t1\\t625\\n511\\t2\\t625\\n512\\t1\\t625\\n514\\t2\\t625\\n515\\t1\\t625\\n516\\t1\\t625\\n518\\t4\\t625\\n519\\t1\\t625\\n520\\t1\\t625\\n521\\t1\\t625\\n522\\t1\\t625\\n523\\t3\\t625\\n524\\t1\\t625\\n525\\t1\\t625\\n526\\t2\\t625\\n527\\t1\\t625\\n528\\t1\\t625\\n529\\t2\\t625\\n530\\t1\\t625\\n531\\t1\\t625\\n532\\t2\\t625\\n534\\t1\\t625\\n535\\t1\\t625\\n546\\t1\\t625\\n553\\t1\\t625\\n554\\t1\\t625\\n565\\t1\\t625\\n574\\t1\\t625\\n575\\t2\\t625\\n577\\t1\\t625\\n579\\t2\\t625\\n591\\t1\\t625\\n594\\t1\\t625\\n595\\t1\\t625\\n599\\t1\\t625\\n603\\t2\\t625\\n604\\t1\\t625\\n606\\t1\\t625\\n609\\t1\\t625\\n610\\t2\\t625\\n611\\t1\\t625\\n612\\t1\\t625\\n615\\t2\\t625\\n619\\t1\\t625\\n620\\t1\\t625\\n621\\t1\\t625\\n625\\t18\\t625\\n626\\t2\\t625\\n629\\t1\\t625\\n630\\t3\\t625\\n631\\t1\\t625\\n634\\t7\\t625\\n636\\t2\\t625\\n637\\t1\\t625\\n642\\t1\\t625\\n643\\t1\\t625\\n644\\t1\\t625\\n646\\t2\\t625\\n648\\t1\\t625\\n649\\t1\\t625\\n650\\t1\\t625\\n652\\t1\\t625\\n660\\t3\\t625\\n692\\t1\\t625\\n696\\t1\\t625\\n699\\t1\\t625\\n700\\t1\\t625\\n703\\t1\\t625\\n705\\t2\\t625\\n707\\t1\\t625\\n708\\t1\\t625\\n726\\t1\\t625\\n727\\t2\\t625\\n728\\t1\\t625\\n731\\t1\\t625\\n732\\t1\\t625\\n733\\t1\\t625\\n734\\t1\\t625\\n736\\t1\\t625\\n738\\t1\\t625\\n739\\t1\\t625\\n740\\t1\\t625\\n741\\t1\\t625\\n742\\t1\\t625\\n743\\t1\\t625\\n744\\t1\\t625\\n748\\t1\\t625\\n752\\t3\\t625\\n754\\t2\\t625\\n755\\t1\\t625\\n756\\t1\\t625\\n762\\t1\\t625\\n764\\t1\\t625\\n780\\t3\\t625\\n785\\t2\\t625\\n791\\t1\\t625\\n795\\t1\\t625\\n803\\t1\\t625\\n810\\t2\\t625\\n811\\t1\\t625\\n812\\t3\\t625\\n814\\t1\\t625\\n816\\t1\\t625\\n817\\t1\\t625\\n818\\t1\\t625\\n820\\t1\\t625\\n822\\t1\\t625\\n823\\t1\\t625\\n824\\t1\\t625\\n826\\t3\\t625\\n827\\t2\\t625\\n829\\t1\\t625\\n830\\t1\\t625\\n843\\t1\\t625\\n844\\t1\\t625\\n846\\t1\\t625\\n875\\t1\\t625\\n879\\t1\\t625\\n883\\t1\\t625\\n893\\t1\\t625\\n895\\t1\\t625\\n907\\t1\\t625\\n915\\t1\\t625\\n961\\t1\\t625\\n962\\t1\\t625\\n964\\t1\\t625\\n994\\t1\\t625\\n1004\\t1\\t625\\n1015\\t1\\t625\\n1016\\t1\\t625\\n1030\\t1\\t625\\n1035\\t1\\t625\\n1045\\t1\\t625\\n1078\\t1\\t625\\n1084\\t1\\t625\\n1089\\t1\\t625\\n1091\\t1\\t625\\n1195\\t1\\t625\\n1201\\t1\\t625\\n1207\\t1\\t625\\n1235\\t1\\t625\\n1242\\t1\\t625\\n1247\\t1\\t625\\n1263\\t1\\t625\\n1264\\t1\\t625\\n1268\\t1\\t625\\n1281\\t1\\t625\\n1282\\t1\\t625\\n1285\\t1\\t625\\n1297\\t1\\t625\\n1303\\t2\\t625\\n1307\\t1\\t625\\n1319\\t1\\t625\\n1327\\t2\\t625\\n1354\\t1\\t625\\n1356\\t1\\t625\\n1357\\t1\\t625\\n1364\\t2\\t625\\n1366\\t1\\t625\\n1367\\t1\\t625\\n1368\\t2\\t625\\n1370\\t1\\t625\\n1372\\t1\\t625\\n1373\\t1\\t625\\n1374\\t1\\t625\\n1375\\t1\\t625\\n1376\\t1\\t625\\n1377\\t1\\t625\\n1386\\t1\\t625\\n1405\\t1\\t625\\n1427\\t1\\t625\\n1427\\t1\\t625\\n.I 626\\n.T\\nThe User Interface for Interactive Bibliographic Searching:\\nAn Analysis of the Attitudes of Nineteen Information Scientists\\n.A\\nMartin, Thomas H.\\nCarlisle, James\\nTreu, Siegfried\\n.W\\n   Since little substantiated evidence exists concerning the features that\\nshould of should not be included in the man-machine interface of interactive\\nbibliographic search and retrieval (IBSR) systems, an informal survey tapping\\nthe opinions of scientists active in this research area was conducted..

For this reason, there\\nare few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, \\nmost of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and\\nretrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to \\ninvestigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. \\nThe working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors\\nand readers is linear in nature (\"one-way\" communication allowing no \\nreciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated\\nby both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri\\nviewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic\\nprocess of communication (\"both-way\" communication).. The survey\\nindicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely\\ndone by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of\\nthesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that\\nsuch a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts\\nof meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two\\ntechniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating\\nof a thesaurus..\\n.X\\n114\\t2\\t627\\n141\\t1\\t627\\n154\\t1\\t627\\n169\\t1\\t627\\n194\\t1\\t627\\n212\\t1\\t627\\n289\\t1\\t627\\n299\\t2\\t627\\n333\\t2\\t627\\n345\\t1\\t627\\n400\\t1\\t627\\n458\\t1\\t627\\n459\\t1\\t627\\n493\\t1\\t627\\n522\\t1\\t627\\n530\\t1\\t627\\n548\\t1\\t627\\n627\\t5\\t627\\n628\\t2\\t627\\n770\\t1\\t627\\n796\\t1\\t627\\n802\\t1\\t627\\n873\\t1\\t627\\n874\\t2\\t627\\n875\\t2\\t627\\n876\\t1\\t627\\n892\\t2\\t627\\n941\\t2\\t627\\n990\\t1\\t627\\n994\\t1\\t627\\n995\\t2\\t627\\n996\\t1\\t627\\n997\\t1\\t627\\n998\\t1\\t627\\n1073\\t1\\t627\\n1079\\t2\\t627\\n1153\\t1\\t627\\n1189\\t1\\t627\\n1251\\t1\\t627\\n1351\\t2\\t627\\n1368\\t1\\t627\\n1392\\t2\\t627\\n1396\\t1\\t627\\n1414\\t1\\t627\\n1420\\t2\\t627\\n1431\\t1\\t627\\n1434\\t2\\t627\\n1435\\t2\\t627\\n1442\\t2\\t627\\n1448\\t2\\t627\\n1448\\t2\\t627\\n.I 628\\n.T\\nThe Environment of Classification:\\nThe Concept of Mutual Exclusivity\\n.A\\nJones, Kevin P.\\n.W\\n   It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage\\nof alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its\\nphilosopher\\'s stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the\\nobservable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of\\nexamples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches\\nand man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like\\ncontinental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also\\nconsidered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..\\n   Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man\\'s mental\\npowers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive\\nseries of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive\\nthinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and\\nthis results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it\\nis observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to\\nexisting classifications and is more likely to be involved in an\\nintegrated approach to problems..\\n.X\\n72\\t1\\t628\\n141\\t1\\t628\\n160\\t1\\t628\\n299\\t2\\t628\\n333\\t3\\t628\\n449\\t1\\t628\\n522\\t1\\t628\\n530\\t2\\t628\\n553\\t1\\t628\\n558\\t2\\t628\\n572\\t1\\t628\\n627\\t2\\t628\\n628\\t5\\t628\\n795\\t1\\t628\\n802\\t1\\t628\\n819\\t1\\t628\\n873\\t1\\t628\\n874\\t3\\t628\\n875\\t2\\t628\\n876\\t1\\t628\\n877\\t1\\t628\\n878\\t1\\t628\\n892\\t2\\t628\\n940\\t1\\t628\\n941\\t3\\t628\\n992\\t1\\t628\\n993\\t1\\t628\\n994\\t1\\t628\\n995\\t3\\t628\\n996\\t1\\t628\\n997\\t1\\t628\\n998\\t1\\t628\\n1046\\t1\\t628\\n1079\\t3\\t628\\n1153\\t1\\t628\\n1189\\t1\\t628\\n1202\\t1\\t628\\n1216\\t1\\t628\\n1218\\t1\\t628\\n1251\\t1\\t628\\n1351\\t2\\t628\\n1396\\t1\\t628\\n1399\\t1\\t628\\n1420\\t2\\t628\\n1421\\t1\\t628\\n1434\\t3\\t628\\n1435\\t3\\t628\\n1436\\t1\\t628\\n1442\\t2\\t628\\n1442\\t2\\t628\\n.I 629\\n.T\\nPromotion of Information Services: An Evaluation of Alternative Approaches\\n.A\\nStern, Louis W.\\n.A\\nCraig, C.

Data were collected to show, for each of the programs:  \\n(1) the level of market penetration achieved; (2) the level of user\\nsatisfaction generated from the service; (3) the effect in terms of\\ninfluence, of the various media employed; and (4) cost effectiveness..\\nData analysis focused on a determination of the most effective methods\\nto promote SDI services..\\n.X\\n9\\t1\\t629\\n18\\t2\\t629\\n34\\t1\\t629\\n49\\t1\\t629\\n53\\t1\\t629\\n59\\t1\\t629\\n125\\t1\\t629\\n128\\t1\\t629\\n130\\t1\\t629\\n145\\t1\\t629\\n164\\t1\\t629\\n191\\t1\\t629\\n202\\t1\\t629\\n207\\t1\\t629\\n211\\t1\\t629\\n213\\t1\\t629\\n222\\t1\\t629\\n223\\t1\\t629\\n224\\t1\\t629\\n243\\t1\\t629\\n296\\t1\\t629\\n297\\t1\\t629\\n298\\t1\\t629\\n300\\t1\\t629\\n301\\t1\\t629\\n302\\t1\\t629\\n339\\t1\\t629\\n358\\t1\\t629\\n364\\t1\\t629\\n370\\t1\\t629\\n376\\t1\\t629\\n378\\t1\\t629\\n387\\t1\\t629\\n421\\t1\\t629\\n440\\t1\\t629\\n452\\t1\\t629\\n453\\t2\\t629\\n465\\t1\\t629\\n466\\t1\\t629\\n467\\t1\\t629\\n468\\t1\\t629\\n490\\t1\\t629\\n491\\t1\\t629\\n495\\t1\\t629\\n506\\t2\\t629\\n507\\t1\\t629\\n508\\t1\\t629\\n510\\t1\\t629\\n511\\t1\\t629\\n512\\t2\\t629\\n514\\t1\\t629\\n515\\t1\\t629\\n517\\t1\\t629\\n520\\t1\\t629\\n521\\t1\\t629\\n523\\t1\\t629\\n524\\t1\\t629\\n526\\t1\\t629\\n528\\t1\\t629\\n535\\t1\\t629\\n576\\t1\\t629\\n580\\t1\\t629\\n591\\t1\\t629\\n595\\t1\\t629\\n603\\t1\\t629\\n604\\t2\\t629\\n609\\t1\\t629\\n612\\t1\\t629\\n619\\t1\\t629\\n622\\t2\\t629\\n623\\t2\\t629\\n625\\t1\\t629\\n629\\t5\\t629\\n631\\t2\\t629\\n632\\t1\\t629\\n633\\t2\\t629\\n634\\t1\\t629\\n639\\t1\\t629\\n648\\t1\\t629\\n652\\t1\\t629\\n659\\t1\\t629\\n676\\t1\\t629\\n699\\t1\\t629\\n700\\t1\\t629\\n705\\t1\\t629\\n707\\t1\\t629\\n711\\t1\\t629\\n722\\t1\\t629\\n723\\t2\\t629\\n726\\t2\\t629\\n727\\t1\\t629\\n728\\t2\\t629\\n729\\t1\\t629\\n730\\t2\\t629\\n731\\t2\\t629\\n732\\t1\\t629\\n754\\t1\\t629\\n791\\t1\\t629\\n809\\t1\\t629\\n810\\t1\\t629\\n811\\t1\\t629\\n812\\t1\\t629\\n813\\t2\\t629\\n814\\t2\\t629\\n816\\t1\\t629\\n818\\t1\\t629\\n820\\t2\\t629\\n822\\t2\\t629\\n823\\t1\\t629\\n828\\t1\\t629\\n843\\t1\\t629\\n844\\t1\\t629\\n846\\t1\\t629\\n866\\t1\\t629\\n870\\t2\\t629\\n873\\t1\\t629\\n879\\t1\\t629\\n915\\t1\\t629\\n961\\t1\\t629\\n962\\t1\\t629\\n964\\t1\\t629\\n994\\t1\\t629\\n1015\\t1\\t629\\n1078\\t1\\t629\\n1089\\t1\\t629\\n1091\\t2\\t629\\n1143\\t1\\t629\\n1242\\t1\\t629\\n1247\\t1\\t629\\n1264\\t1\\t629\\n1268\\t1\\t629\\n1283\\t1\\t629\\n1298\\t1\\t629\\n1299\\t1\\t629\\n1302\\t1\\t629\\n1303\\t1\\t629\\n1354\\t1\\t629\\n1356\\t1\\t629\\n1363\\t1\\t629\\n1366\\t2\\t629\\n1367\\t2\\t629\\n1368\\t2\\t629\\n1376\\t1\\t629\\n1396\\t2\\t629\\n1403\\t1\\t629\\n1457\\t1\\t629\\n1457\\t1\\t629\\n.I 630\\n.T\\nA Novel Philosophy for the Design of Information Storage\\nand Retrieval Systems Appropriate for the \\'70\\'s\\n.A\\nScheffler, Frederic L.\\n.W\\n   The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information\\nstorage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is\\nrecognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective\\nalternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent\\nphilosophy of the \\'60\\'s in which many information systems designers\\ntouted the computer as the answer to all information storage and\\nretrieval situations.. Important principles of information system\\ndesign incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy\\nfor the \\'70\\'s are presented.. These are:  the performance of users\\'\\nneeds studies by the representative small group technique; the\\nanalysis of users\\' needs including their rank ordering by priority; \\nthe selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable\\nexistent information storage and retrieval system from those available; \\nthe involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing\\na model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final\\ndesign of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising from\\nearlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of these\\npitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed.. \\n.X\\n120\\t1\\t630\\n124\\t1\\t630\\n127\\t1\\t630\\n128\\t1\\t630\\n129\\t1\\t630\\n135\\t1\\t630\\n141\\t1\\t630\\n175\\t1\\t630\\n190\\t1\\t630\\n191\\t1\\t630\\n197\\t1\\t630\\n211\\t1\\t630\\n214\\t1\\t630\\n218\\t1\\t630\\n224\\t1\\t630\\n243\\t1\\t630\\n244\\t2\\t630\\n245\\t1\\t630\\n291\\t1\\t630\\n298\\t1\\t630\\n299\\t1\\t630\\n307\\t1\\t630\\n330\\t1\\t630\\n365\\t1\\t630\\n378\\t1\\t630\\n381\\t1\\t630\\n450\\t1\\t630\\n451\\t1\\t630\\n452\\t1\\t630\\n456\\t1\\t630\\n458\\t1\\t630\\n459\\t2\\t630\\n468\\t2\\t630\\n484\\t1\\t630\\n492\\t1\\t630\\n508\\t1\\t630\\n511\\t1\\t630\\n512\\t1\\t630\\n514\\t2\\t630\\n518\\t2\\t630\\n520\\t1\\t630\\n523\\t2\\t630\\n524\\t1\\t630\\n525\\t1\\t630\\n526\\t1\\t630\\n529\\t2\\t630\\n530\\t1\\t630\\n534\\t1\\t630\\n546\\t1\\t630\\n553\\t1\\t630\\n554\\t1\\t630\\n575\\t2\\t630\\n579\\t2\\t630\\n591\\t1\\t630\\n594\\t1\\t630\\n595\\t1\\t630\\n599\\t2\\t630\\n603\\t2\\t630\\n604\\t1\\t630\\n606\\t1\\t630\\n609\\t1\\t630\\n610\\t1\\t630\\n611\\t1\\t630\\n612\\t1\\t630\\n615\\t1\\t630\\n619\\t1\\t630\\n620\\t1\\t630\\n621\\t2\\t630\\n625\\t3\\t630\\n626\\t1\\t630\\n630\\t5\\t630\\n634\\t1\\t630\\n636\\t1\\t630\\n637\\t1\\t630\\n642\\t1\\t630\\n648\\t1\\t630\\n650\\t1\\t630\\n692\\t2\\t630\\n696\\t1\\t630\\n699\\t1\\t630\\n703\\t1\\t630\\n705\\t1\\t630\\n708\\t1\\t630\\n726\\t1\\t630\\n727\\t1\\t630\\n728\\t1\\t630\\n731\\t1\\t630\\n732\\t1\\t630\\n733\\t1\\t630\\n734\\t1\\t630\\n736\\t1\\t630\\n738\\t1\\t630\\n739\\t1\\t630\\n740\\t1\\t630\\n741\\t1\\t630\\n742\\t1\\t630\\n743\\t1\\t630\\n744\\t1\\t630\\n752\\t1\\t630\\n755\\t1\\t630\\n780\\t1\\t630\\n820\\t1\\t630\\n822\\t2\\t630\\n826\\t1\\t630\\n827\\t1\\t630\\n854\\t1\\t630\\n871\\t1\\t630\\n872\\t1\\t630\\n873\\t1\\t630\\n874\\t1\\t630\\n875\\t1\\t630\\n876\\t1\\t630\\n877\\t1\\t630\\n878\\t1\\t630\\n879\\t2\\t630\\n880\\t1\\t630\\n883\\t1\\t630\\n892\\t1\\t630\\n907\\t1\\t630\\n925\\t1\\t630\\n940\\t1\\t630\\n941\\t1\\t630\\n990\\t1\\t630\\n994\\t1\\t630\\n997\\t1\\t630\\n998\\t1\\t630\\n1004\\t1\\t630\\n1035\\t1\\t630\\n1078\\t1\\t630\\n1079\\t1\\t630\\n1089\\t1\\t630\\n1091\\t1\\t630\\n1143\\t1\\t630\\n1207\\t1\\t630\\n1230\\t1\\t630\\n1257\\t1\\t630\\n1264\\t1\\t630\\n1297\\t1\\t630\\n1303\\t2\\t630\\n1356\\t1\\t630\\n1364\\t1\\t630\\n1368\\t1\\t630\\n1370\\t1\\t630\\n1372\\t1\\t630\\n1373\\t1\\t630\\n1374\\t1\\t630\\n1375\\t1\\t630\\n1376\\t1\\t630\\n1377\\t1\\t630\\n1396\\t1\\t630\\n1402\\t1\\t630\\n1435\\t1\\t630\\n1436\\t1\\t630\\n1436\\t1\\t630\\n.I 631\\n.T\\nA General Statistical Model for Estimating Future Demand Levels of Data-Base\\nUtilization Within an Information Retrieval Organization\\n.A\\nWare, Glenn O.\\n.W\\n   A statistical model for characterizing the growth patterns of data base\\nutilization and for estimating future utilization levels of demand has been\\ndeveloped for information retrieval organizations..

Implementation of the Philosophy\\n.A\\nCooper,  William S.\\n.W\\n   It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the best\\nway to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicit\\nsubjective estimates of the system\\'s utility to its users, quantified in\\nterms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willing\\nto give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naive\\nmethodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis..\\nBut the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises\\nthe questions:\\tHow can one decide which practical measure is likely to\\nyield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And\\nhow can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying\\nthe measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to\\nthese problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in terms\\nof the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from\\nthe naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it by\\nexperimentation..\\n.X\\n9\\t1\\t634\\n57\\t1\\t634\\n73\\t1\\t634\\n120\\t1\\t634\\n123\\t1\\t634\\n131\\t1\\t634\\n167\\t1\\t634\\n197\\t1\\t634\\n207\\t1\\t634\\n222\\t1\\t634\\n223\\t1\\t634\\n274\\t1\\t634\\n296\\t1\\t634\\n297\\t1\\t634\\n298\\t1\\t634\\n300\\t1\\t634\\n301\\t1\\t634\\n302\\t1\\t634\\n358\\t1\\t634\\n359\\t1\\t634\\n364\\t1\\t634\\n382\\t1\\t634\\n390\\t1\\t634\\n445\\t1\\t634\\n449\\t1\\t634\\n468\\t1\\t634\\n506\\t1\\t634\\n515\\t1\\t634\\n518\\t2\\t634\\n523\\t1\\t634\\n531\\t1\\t634\\n535\\t1\\t634\\n577\\t1\\t634\\n625\\t7\\t634\\n629\\t1\\t634\\n630\\t1\\t634\\n631\\t1\\t634\\n634\\t9\\t634\\n643\\t1\\t634\\n644\\t1\\t634\\n649\\t1\\t634\\n652\\t1\\t634\\n660\\t1\\t634\\n696\\t1\\t634\\n705\\t1\\t634\\n736\\t1\\t634\\n748\\t1\\t634\\n752\\t1\\t634\\n754\\t1\\t634\\n756\\t1\\t634\\n780\\t1\\t634\\n785\\t1\\t634\\n791\\t2\\t634\\n795\\t1\\t634\\n804\\t1\\t634\\n810\\t1\\t634\\n811\\t1\\t634\\n812\\t2\\t634\\n814\\t1\\t634\\n816\\t1\\t634\\n818\\t1\\t634\\n823\\t1\\t634\\n826\\t1\\t634\\n829\\t1\\t634\\n830\\t1\\t634\\n843\\t1\\t634\\n844\\t1\\t634\\n846\\t1\\t634\\n895\\t1\\t634\\n915\\t1\\t634\\n961\\t1\\t634\\n962\\t1\\t634\\n964\\t1\\t634\\n994\\t1\\t634\\n1015\\t1\\t634\\n1019\\t1\\t634\\n1037\\t1\\t634\\n1242\\t1\\t634\\n1247\\t1\\t634\\n1268\\t1\\t634\\n1282\\t1\\t634\\n1327\\t1\\t634\\n1354\\t1\\t634\\n1354\\t1\\t634\\n.I 635\\n.T\\nClustering of Scientific Journals\\n.A\\nCarpenter, Mark P.\\nNarin, Francis\\n.W\\nA cluster analysis procedure is described in which 188 journals in the\\ndiscipline of physics, chemistry and molecular biology are grouped into \\nclusters..

Since the goal of the\\ntechniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" are\\nretrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providing\\nor \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the document \\ncontaining it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., \\nsingle-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages\\nfor screening retrieval output..\\n   Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation\\nbetween clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates\\nsyntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntactic\\njoints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation\\nmarks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word\\nproximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well..\\n   The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determining\\nwhen a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure\\nwas found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, \\nwhich were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers..\\n   In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two \\nanswer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of\\none multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure\\nof clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they\\nretrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, \\nwhich has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results..\\n   The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in\\nthis study were from the field of information science.. The results of the\\nstudy are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" and\\nit is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologies\\nthe techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a \\ndissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t636\\n75\\t1\\t636\\n86\\t1\\t636\\n124\\t2\\t636\\n125\\t1\\t636\\n127\\t2\\t636\\n129\\t1\\t636\\n145\\t1\\t636\\n165\\t1\\t636\\n175\\t1\\t636\\n190\\t1\\t636\\n191\\t1\\t636\\n197\\t1\\t636\\n211\\t1\\t636\\n214\\t1\\t636\\n218\\t1\\t636\\n243\\t1\\t636\\n307\\t1\\t636\\n330\\t1\\t636\\n357\\t1\\t636\\n376\\t1\\t636\\n378\\t1\\t636\\n381\\t1\\t636\\n382\\t1\\t636\\n389\\t1\\t636\\n390\\t1\\t636\\n448\\t1\\t636\\n450\\t1\\t636\\n451\\t1\\t636\\n452\\t2\\t636\\n459\\t2\\t636\\n468\\t1\\t636\\n484\\t2\\t636\\n492\\t1\\t636\\n508\\t1\\t636\\n511\\t2\\t636\\n512\\t1\\t636\\n514\\t3\\t636\\n516\\t1\\t636\\n518\\t2\\t636\\n520\\t2\\t636\\n521\\t1\\t636\\n522\\t1\\t636\\n523\\t2\\t636\\n524\\t2\\t636\\n525\\t2\\t636\\n526\\t2\\t636\\n527\\t2\\t636\\n528\\t1\\t636\\n529\\t3\\t636\\n530\\t2\\t636\\n534\\t2\\t636\\n546\\t1\\t636\\n553\\t1\\t636\\n570\\t1\\t636\\n575\\t1\\t636\\n576\\t1\\t636\\n579\\t1\\t636\\n586\\t1\\t636\\n594\\t1\\t636\\n603\\t1\\t636\\n604\\t1\\t636\\n606\\t1\\t636\\n608\\t1\\t636\\n609\\t2\\t636\\n610\\t2\\t636\\n611\\t1\\t636\\n612\\t1\\t636\\n615\\t1\\t636\\n625\\t2\\t636\\n626\\t2\\t636\\n630\\t1\\t636\\n633\\t1\\t636\\n635\\t1\\t636\\n636\\t6\\t636\\n637\\t2\\t636\\n642\\t2\\t636\\n643\\t1\\t636\\n648\\t1\\t636\\n650\\t1\\t636\\n659\\t1\\t636\\n692\\t1\\t636\\n696\\t1\\t636\\n699\\t1\\t636\\n700\\t1\\t636\\n702\\t1\\t636\\n703\\t2\\t636\\n705\\t2\\t636\\n707\\t1\\t636\\n708\\t1\\t636\\n726\\t2\\t636\\n727\\t2\\t636\\n728\\t1\\t636\\n730\\t1\\t636\\n731\\t1\\t636\\n732\\t2\\t636\\n733\\t2\\t636\\n734\\t2\\t636\\n736\\t2\\t636\\n738\\t1\\t636\\n739\\t1\\t636\\n740\\t1\\t636\\n741\\t1\\t636\\n742\\t1\\t636\\n743\\t1\\t636\\n744\\t1\\t636\\n754\\t1\\t636\\n755\\t1\\t636\\n812\\t1\\t636\\n817\\t1\\t636\\n820\\t2\\t636\\n824\\t1\\t636\\n826\\t2\\t636\\n827\\t2\\t636\\n875\\t1\\t636\\n877\\t1\\t636\\n879\\t2\\t636\\n883\\t1\\t636\\n894\\t1\\t636\\n1004\\t1\\t636\\n1035\\t1\\t636\\n1078\\t1\\t636\\n1089\\t1\\t636\\n1091\\t1\\t636\\n1207\\t1\\t636\\n1264\\t1\\t636\\n1294\\t1\\t636\\n1297\\t1\\t636\\n1303\\t2\\t636\\n1313\\t1\\t636\\n1327\\t2\\t636\\n1356\\t1\\t636\\n1364\\t2\\t636\\n1366\\t1\\t636\\n1367\\t1\\t636\\n1368\\t2\\t636\\n1370\\t2\\t636\\n1372\\t2\\t636\\n1373\\t1\\t636\\n1374\\t1\\t636\\n1375\\t1\\t636\\n1376\\t1\\t636\\n1377\\t1\\t636\\n1383\\t1\\t636\\n1396\\t1\\t636\\n1419\\t1\\t636\\n1419\\t1\\t636\\n.I 637\\n.T\\nBreaking the Communication barrier Between Searcher and Literature \\nFile: An Interactive Guide\\n.A\\nSchultz, Louise\\n.W\\n   The challenges of design of programming systems, file organization\\nand manipulation, and user-oriented query languages have held the spotlight\\nin the development of data processing support to systems for retrieval of\\nscientific literature..

A central theme of every conference that I have attended related\\nto:  \"What is information science?\" Or \"Is information science a science?\"\\nIn this paper I hope to take these questions head on.. I must begin by\\nsaying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I see\\nit as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and\\nman\\'s interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest for\\nunderstanding is the greatest challenge of the science..\\n   I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on the\\nscientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view is\\nthe scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment to\\nthe present..

The various\\nindex languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences\\nin their performance are correspondingly great..\\n   The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages\\nis due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships\\namong concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and\\nretrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a\\ngraph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these\\npoints represent concept relations..

The emphasis placed on direct \\naccess by the practitioners in the field, rather than delegated searches through\\ninformation specialists, leads to the growing need for an efficient design in \\ntraining transient user groups.. Printed manuals, live help, audiovisual \\npresentations and on-line instructions have all been used with varying degrees of\\nsuccess.. The author contends that the use of computer-assisted instruction in \\nconjunction with the on-line information retrieval system is the most promising\\nform of instruction in that the medium itself, as well as the message may be \\nused to acquaint the novice searcher with an interactive user/system \\ninterface..\\n.X\\n124\\t2\\t648\\n127\\t1\\t648\\n128\\t1\\t648\\n129\\t1\\t648\\n130\\t1\\t648\\n190\\t2\\t648\\n191\\t3\\t648\\n197\\t1\\t648\\n211\\t1\\t648\\n214\\t1\\t648\\n218\\t1\\t648\\n243\\t1\\t648\\n307\\t1\\t648\\n330\\t1\\t648\\n339\\t1\\t648\\n370\\t2\\t648\\n376\\t1\\t648\\n378\\t1\\t648\\n387\\t1\\t648\\n450\\t1\\t648\\n451\\t1\\t648\\n452\\t1\\t648\\n453\\t1\\t648\\n459\\t2\\t648\\n468\\t1\\t648\\n484\\t1\\t648\\n492\\t1\\t648\\n508\\t1\\t648\\n511\\t1\\t648\\n512\\t1\\t648\\n514\\t2\\t648\\n518\\t1\\t648\\n520\\t1\\t648\\n523\\t1\\t648\\n524\\t1\\t648\\n525\\t1\\t648\\n526\\t1\\t648\\n529\\t1\\t648\\n530\\t1\\t648\\n534\\t1\\t648\\n546\\t1\\t648\\n547\\t1\\t648\\n553\\t1\\t648\\n579\\t1\\t648\\n594\\t1\\t648\\n603\\t1\\t648\\n604\\t1\\t648\\n606\\t1\\t648\\n609\\t1\\t648\\n610\\t1\\t648\\n611\\t1\\t648\\n612\\t1\\t648\\n625\\t1\\t648\\n626\\t1\\t648\\n629\\t1\\t648\\n630\\t1\\t648\\n636\\t1\\t648\\n637\\t1\\t648\\n642\\t2\\t648\\n643\\t1\\t648\\n648\\t7\\t648\\n650\\t1\\t648\\n652\\t1\\t648\\n692\\t1\\t648\\n696\\t1\\t648\\n699\\t1\\t648\\n703\\t1\\t648\\n705\\t1\\t648\\n708\\t1\\t648\\n726\\t1\\t648\\n727\\t1\\t648\\n728\\t1\\t648\\n731\\t1\\t648\\n732\\t1\\t648\\n733\\t1\\t648\\n734\\t2\\t648\\n736\\t2\\t648\\n738\\t1\\t648\\n739\\t1\\t648\\n740\\t1\\t648\\n741\\t1\\t648\\n742\\t2\\t648\\n743\\t3\\t648\\n744\\t1\\t648\\n755\\t1\\t648\\n768\\t1\\t648\\n774\\t1\\t648\\n818\\t1\\t648\\n820\\t1\\t648\\n826\\t1\\t648\\n827\\t1\\t648\\n839\\t1\\t648\\n847\\t1\\t648\\n879\\t1\\t648\\n883\\t2\\t648\\n1004\\t1\\t648\\n1035\\t1\\t648\\n1078\\t1\\t648\\n1089\\t1\\t648\\n1091\\t1\\t648\\n1146\\t1\\t648\\n1207\\t1\\t648\\n1246\\t1\\t648\\n1264\\t1\\t648\\n1297\\t1\\t648\\n1303\\t2\\t648\\n1356\\t1\\t648\\n1364\\t1\\t648\\n1368\\t1\\t648\\n1370\\t1\\t648\\n1372\\t1\\t648\\n1373\\t1\\t648\\n1374\\t2\\t648\\n1375\\t2\\t648\\n1376\\t2\\t648\\n1377\\t1\\t648\\n1403\\t1\\t648\\n1457\\t1\\t648\\n1457\\t1\\t648\\n.I 649\\n.T\\nA Probabilistic Approach to Automatic Keyword Indexing\\nPart I.

The fit of the model is tested on an\\nexperimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the\\npurposes of the study..

The concern \\nwith relevance, as a key notion in information science, is traced to the \\nproblems of scientific communication.. Relevance is considered as a measure of \\nthe effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a \\ncommunication process.. The different views of relevance that emerged are\\ninterpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge..\\nDifferent views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different \\npoints in the process of knowledge communication..

However, they may\\nremember a surprising amount of such \"nonstandard\" information as the\\ncolor of the document\\'s cover or its approximate length.. Could this\\ntype of \"nonstandard\" information be profitably exploited in computerized\\ncatalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be\\nused, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today\\'s\\nlibrary patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial\\nminority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of\\na memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of\\nnonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according\\nto relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various\\nnonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average\\npatron\\'s nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval\\nstrategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth\\nas many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great\\nenough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many\\nsituations..\\n.X\\n35\\t1\\t655\\n42\\t1\\t655\\n43\\t1\\t655\\n52\\t1\\t655\\n70\\t1\\t655\\n73\\t1\\t655\\n76\\t1\\t655\\n81\\t1\\t655\\n95\\t2\\t655\\n104\\t1\\t655\\n110\\t1\\t655\\n132\\t1\\t655\\n159\\t2\\t655\\n161\\t1\\t655\\n257\\t1\\t655\\n274\\t1\\t655\\n276\\t2\\t655\\n348\\t1\\t655\\n420\\t1\\t655\\n429\\t1\\t655\\n489\\t1\\t655\\n493\\t1\\t655\\n498\\t1\\t655\\n501\\t1\\t655\\n578\\t1\\t655\\n582\\t3\\t655\\n583\\t2\\t655\\n584\\t1\\t655\\n585\\t1\\t655\\n589\\t2\\t655\\n594\\t1\\t655\\n595\\t1\\t655\\n653\\t1\\t655\\n655\\t6\\t655\\n656\\t1\\t655\\n657\\t1\\t655\\n688\\t1\\t655\\n783\\t2\\t655\\n796\\t1\\t655\\n797\\t2\\t655\\n798\\t2\\t655\\n799\\t1\\t655\\n801\\t1\\t655\\n802\\t1\\t655\\n858\\t1\\t655\\n859\\t1\\t655\\n861\\t1\\t655\\n1054\\t1\\t655\\n1154\\t1\\t655\\n1232\\t1\\t655\\n1281\\t1\\t655\\n1287\\t1\\t655\\n1295\\t1\\t655\\n1297\\t1\\t655\\n1298\\t1\\t655\\n1300\\t1\\t655\\n1405\\t1\\t655\\n1445\\t1\\t655\\n1445\\t1\\t655\\n.I 656\\n.T\\nMeasures of the Usefulness of Written Technical Information\\nto Chemical Researchers\\n.A\\nKegan,  Daniel L.\\n.W\\n   The effective transfer of technology involves more than just\\ndistributing paper; it demands that useful documents be disseminated with a\\nminimum of useless ones.. For 1 month, 10 researchers recorded a sample of\\nthe written technical information items that they received; 4 months later\\nthey were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful, \\nand in what ways..\\n   The results indicate that (1) a researcher will call an item \"useful\"\\neven if it does not cause him to take some action, but only has some\\nsignificance for him; (2) the more the source of an item knows about the needs\\nof the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks, \\nthe more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful; (3) \\nno strong relationships were found between certain readily observable,\\nphysical arrangements and information behavior; and (4) an item may prove\\nuseful, not because of the information objectively contained in that item, \\nbut because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researcher\\'s\\nmind or a \"free association.\"\\n   Other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness\\nto externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness\\nmay not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher..\\n.X\\n29\\t1\\t656\\n35\\t1\\t656\\n42\\t1\\t656\\n43\\t1\\t656\\n52\\t1\\t656\\n58\\t1\\t656\\n70\\t1\\t656\\n73\\t1\\t656\\n81\\t1\\t656\\n89\\t1\\t656\\n95\\t1\\t656\\n105\\t1\\t656\\n109\\t1\\t656\\n110\\t1\\t656\\n155\\t1\\t656\\n157\\t2\\t656\\n165\\t1\\t656\\n314\\t1\\t656\\n356\\t1\\t656\\n420\\t1\\t656\\n426\\t1\\t656\\n445\\t1\\t656\\n451\\t1\\t656\\n475\\t1\\t656\\n544\\t1\\t656\\n560\\t1\\t656\\n578\\t1\\t656\\n582\\t2\\t656\\n589\\t1\\t656\\n590\\t1\\t656\\n594\\t1\\t656\\n595\\t1\\t656\\n609\\t1\\t656\\n655\\t1\\t656\\n656\\t5\\t656\\n657\\t1\\t656\\n658\\t1\\t656\\n685\\t1\\t656\\n689\\t1\\t656\\n762\\t1\\t656\\n814\\t1\\t656\\n901\\t1\\t656\\n1030\\t1\\t656\\n1050\\t1\\t656\\n1054\\t1\\t656\\n1062\\t1\\t656\\n1077\\t1\\t656\\n1154\\t1\\t656\\n1231\\t1\\t656\\n1232\\t1\\t656\\n1256\\t1\\t656\\n1281\\t1\\t656\\n1284\\t1\\t656\\n1285\\t1\\t656\\n1290\\t1\\t656\\n1291\\t1\\t656\\n1293\\t1\\t656\\n1294\\t1\\t656\\n1295\\t2\\t656\\n1296\\t1\\t656\\n1297\\t1\\t656\\n1298\\t1\\t656\\n1319\\t1\\t656\\n1321\\t1\\t656\\n1346\\t1\\t656\\n1361\\t1\\t656\\n1386\\t1\\t656\\n1386\\t1\\t656\\n.I 657\\n.T\\nStandards For Writing Abstracts\\n.A\\nWeil, Ben H.\\n.W\\n   An abstract, as defined here, is an abbreviated, accurate representation\\nof a document..

State the\\npurpose, methods results, and conclusions presented in the document, either\\nin that order or with initial emphasis on findings..\\n   Make each abstract self-contained but concise; retain the basic information\\nand tone of the original document..  Keep abstracts of most papers to \\nfewer than 250 words, abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words\\n(preferably on one page), and abstracts of short communications to fewer\\nthan 100 words.. Write most abstracts in a single paragraph.. Normally\\nemploy complete, connected sentences; active verbs; ad the third person..\\nEmploy standard nomenclature, or define unfamiliar terms, abbreviations, and\\nsymbols the first time they occur in the abstract..\\n.X\\n35\\t2\\t657\\n42\\t1\\t657\\n43\\t1\\t657\\n52\\t1\\t657\\n70\\t1\\t657\\n73\\t1\\t657\\n81\\t1\\t657\\n91\\t1\\t657\\n95\\t1\\t657\\n166\\t1\\t657\\n175\\t2\\t657\\n324\\t1\\t657\\n420\\t2\\t657\\n429\\t1\\t657\\n491\\t1\\t657\\n496\\t1\\t657\\n499\\t1\\t657\\n503\\t2\\t657\\n513\\t1\\t657\\n517\\t1\\t657\\n571\\t2\\t657\\n576\\t2\\t657\\n578\\t1\\t657\\n582\\t3\\t657\\n588\\t1\\t657\\n589\\t4\\t657\\n594\\t1\\t657\\n595\\t1\\t657\\n603\\t1\\t657\\n613\\t1\\t657\\n614\\t1\\t657\\n618\\t1\\t657\\n655\\t1\\t657\\n656\\t1\\t657\\n657\\t10\\t657\\n666\\t1\\t657\\n685\\t1\\t657\\n686\\t1\\t657\\n690\\t1\\t657\\n691\\t1\\t657\\n712\\t2\\t657\\n721\\t1\\t657\\n722\\t1\\t657\\n724\\t1\\t657\\n725\\t1\\t657\\n958\\t1\\t657\\n987\\t1\\t657\\n988\\t1\\t657\\n1012\\t1\\t657\\n1054\\t2\\t657\\n1144\\t1\\t657\\n1154\\t1\\t657\\n1208\\t1\\t657\\n1232\\t1\\t657\\n1281\\t1\\t657\\n1293\\t2\\t657\\n1295\\t2\\t657\\n1296\\t1\\t657\\n1298\\t1\\t657\\n1302\\t1\\t657\\n1302\\t1\\t657\\n.I 658\\n.T\\nCriteria Used by Research and Development Engineers in the Selection \\nof an Information Source\\n.A\\nGerstberger, Peter G.\\n.A\\nAllen, Thomas J.\\n.W\\n   The criteria employed by engineers in the selection of various technical\\ninformation channels in problem-solving endeavors are investigated..

E.\\n.A\\nKuhns, J. L. \\n.W\\n   This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and\\nsearching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is taken\\nas the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative\\nconcept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. \\nThe resulting technique called \"Probabilistic Indexing,\" allows a computing\\nmachine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference\\nand derive a number (called the \"relevance number\") for each document, which\\nis a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request\\nranked according to their probable relevance..\\n   The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library\\nsystem the cross-referencing (\"see\" and \"see also\") is based solely on\\nthe \"semantical closeness\" between index terms, statistical measures of\\ncloseness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given\\nan arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine\\ncan elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant\\ndocuments that would not otherwise have been selected..\\n   Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library\\nproblem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of\\nwhich the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference\\nin order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents\\nwhich most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..\\n.X\\n26\\t3\\t660\\n29\\t1\\t660\\n35\\t1\\t660\\n42\\t1\\t660\\n43\\t2\\t660\\n51\\t3\\t660\\n54\\t2\\t660\\n57\\t1\\t660\\n58\\t1\\t660\\n61\\t1\\t660\\n69\\t1\\t660\\n70\\t1\\t660\\n73\\t2\\t660\\n75\\t2\\t660\\n79\\t2\\t660\\n84\\t1\\t660\\n114\\t1\\t660\\n144\\t1\\t660\\n150\\t2\\t660\\n174\\t1\\t660\\n175\\t3\\t660\\n176\\t2\\t660\\n274\\t1\\t660\\n309\\t1\\t660\\n315\\t1\\t660\\n319\\t2\\t660\\n321\\t1\\t660\\n328\\t2\\t660\\n389\\t1\\t660\\n390\\t2\\t660\\n419\\t5\\t660\\n422\\t2\\t660\\n441\\t3\\t660\\n444\\t1\\t660\\n445\\t3\\t660\\n447\\t1\\t660\\n448\\t1\\t660\\n449\\t2\\t660\\n457\\t1\\t660\\n458\\t2\\t660\\n462\\t1\\t660\\n471\\t1\\t660\\n474\\t1\\t660\\n479\\t1\\t660\\n485\\t1\\t660\\n486\\t1\\t660\\n509\\t1\\t660\\n518\\t1\\t660\\n519\\t1\\t660\\n531\\t1\\t660\\n532\\t1\\t660\\n562\\t3\\t660\\n564\\t2\\t660\\n565\\t3\\t660\\n566\\t2\\t660\\n570\\t1\\t660\\n575\\t2\\t660\\n577\\t5\\t660\\n625\\t3\\t660\\n634\\t1\\t660\\n643\\t1\\t660\\n644\\t3\\t660\\n649\\t2\\t660\\n652\\t2\\t660\\n660\\t21\\t660\\n661\\t2\\t660\\n662\\t5\\t660\\n663\\t1\\t660\\n664\\t2\\t660\\n714\\t1\\t660\\n752\\t2\\t660\\n754\\t1\\t660\\n762\\t2\\t660\\n764\\t1\\t660\\n769\\t1\\t660\\n780\\t3\\t660\\n785\\t3\\t660\\n806\\t1\\t660\\n810\\t3\\t660\\n812\\t3\\t660\\n824\\t2\\t660\\n829\\t1\\t660\\n830\\t1\\t660\\n893\\t1\\t660\\n895\\t1\\t660\\n956\\t1\\t660\\n960\\t1\\t660\\n1016\\t1\\t660\\n1030\\t1\\t660\\n1044\\t1\\t660\\n1045\\t1\\t660\\n1084\\t1\\t660\\n1144\\t1\\t660\\n1154\\t1\\t660\\n1195\\t1\\t660\\n1201\\t1\\t660\\n1202\\t2\\t660\\n1218\\t2\\t660\\n1219\\t1\\t660\\n1235\\t1\\t660\\n1281\\t1\\t660\\n1282\\t3\\t660\\n1285\\t1\\t660\\n1294\\t2\\t660\\n1307\\t1\\t660\\n1327\\t2\\t660\\n1382\\t1\\t660\\n1427\\t1\\t660\\n1427\\t1\\t660\\n.I 661\\n.T\\nIs Automatic Classification a Reasonable Application of Statistical\\nAnalysis of Text?\\n.A\\nDoyle, Lauren B.\\n.W\\n   The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and\\nretrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machine\\nsearching and automatic classification.. The former approach has been\\nfavored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for\\nnew methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those\\nof traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been\\nthriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed..\\n   The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated\\nat considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support the\\nhypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about\\neach document is used for input to the classification program.. Six\\nnonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100\\nkeyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer\\nruns in which the number of words per document is increased progressively\\nfrom 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and\\ntwo point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the\\nrange of one through eight words per document..\\n   Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practical\\nproblems to be faced are outlined..      \\n.X\\n26\\t1\\t661\\n28\\t1\\t661\\n30\\t1\\t661\\n42\\t1\\t661\\n43\\t1\\t661\\n45\\t1\\t661\\n72\\t1\\t661\\n79\\t1\\t661\\n174\\t2\\t661\\n176\\t1\\t661\\n309\\t1\\t661\\n310\\t1\\t661\\n328\\t2\\t661\\n363\\t1\\t661\\n389\\t1\\t661\\n390\\t1\\t661\\n419\\t2\\t661\\n422\\t1\\t661\\n434\\t1\\t661\\n454\\t1\\t661\\n479\\t2\\t661\\n483\\t2\\t661\\n485\\t2\\t661\\n562\\t1\\t661\\n564\\t3\\t661\\n565\\t3\\t661\\n660\\t2\\t661\\n661\\t6\\t661\\n662\\t2\\t661\\n663\\t3\\t661\\n664\\t1\\t661\\n714\\t1\\t661\\n769\\t2\\t661\\n1144\\t1\\t661\\n1327\\t2\\t661\\n1414\\t1\\t661\\n1419\\t1\\t661\\n1448\\t1\\t661\\n1448\\t1\\t661\\n.I 662\\n.T\\nAutomatic Indexing: An Experimental Inquiry\\n.A\\nMaron, M.

Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led\\nprimarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered\\naround the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions \\nhave been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who\\nknows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal\\ncorrespondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention \\nhas been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The\\nresulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs\\nof machine but not adapted to the needs of humans..\\n   We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking\\nto a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and\\nmore mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between\\nthe reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly\\nand swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for..\\n.X\\n13\\t1\\t664\\n26\\t4\\t664\\n35\\t1\\t664\\n45\\t1\\t664\\n51\\t1\\t664\\n61\\t1\\t664\\n66\\t1\\t664\\n114\\t1\\t664\\n117\\t1\\t664\\n144\\t1\\t664\\n152\\t1\\t664\\n174\\t1\\t664\\n175\\t2\\t664\\n176\\t1\\t664\\n179\\t1\\t664\\n315\\t2\\t664\\n320\\t1\\t664\\n363\\t1\\t664\\n419\\t3\\t664\\n420\\t2\\t664\\n421\\t1\\t664\\n458\\t1\\t664\\n475\\t1\\t664\\n479\\t1\\t664\\n485\\t1\\t664\\n499\\t1\\t664\\n562\\t3\\t664\\n564\\t2\\t664\\n566\\t1\\t664\\n571\\t1\\t664\\n572\\t1\\t664\\n577\\t1\\t664\\n590\\t1\\t664\\n644\\t1\\t664\\n659\\t1\\t664\\n660\\t2\\t664\\n661\\t1\\t664\\n662\\t3\\t664\\n663\\t2\\t664\\n664\\t8\\t664\\n666\\t1\\t664\\n769\\t1\\t664\\n783\\t1\\t664\\n837\\t1\\t664\\n839\\t1\\t664\\n907\\t1\\t664\\n968\\t1\\t664\\n1046\\t1\\t664\\n1118\\t1\\t664\\n1144\\t1\\t664\\n1279\\t1\\t664\\n1327\\t1\\t664\\n1381\\t1\\t664\\n1382\\t1\\t664\\n1443\\t1\\t664\\n1443\\t1\\t664\\n.I 665\\n.T\\nMorphology of \"Information Flow\"\\n.A\\nFairthorne, R.A.\\n.W\\n  Such phrases as \"information flow\" may be purely metaphorical, or may refer to\\nporterage and storage of physical documents, transmission of signals, power\\nrequired for signaling, Shannon\\'s Selective Information, changes in the state of\\none\\'s personal knowledge, propagation of announcements concerning messages, \\nsocial increase of awareness, propagation of or reaction to imperatives, and so\\non.

While previous work has focused on one component of sentence\\nsignificance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words),\\nthe methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic\\nwords (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence\\nlocation).\\n  The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology.\\nThe extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of\\nthe above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures for\\nthe compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control\\nparameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with\\nmanually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposed\\ncomponents dominate the frequency component in the production of better \\nextracts.\\n  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentence \\nselection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words,\\nkey words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, research\\nmethodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation.\\n.X\\n26\\t1\\t666\\n30\\t1\\t666\\n35\\t1\\t666\\n39\\t1\\t666\\n71\\t1\\t666\\n75\\t1\\t666\\n77\\t1\\t666\\n78\\t1\\t666\\n79\\t1\\t666\\n80\\t1\\t666\\n81\\t1\\t666\\n82\\t1\\t666\\n83\\t1\\t666\\n114\\t1\\t666\\n154\\t1\\t666\\n175\\t2\\t666\\n212\\t1\\t666\\n247\\t1\\t666\\n315\\t2\\t666\\n324\\t1\\t666\\n420\\t4\\t666\\n458\\t1\\t666\\n499\\t3\\t666\\n503\\t1\\t666\\n516\\t1\\t666\\n527\\t1\\t666\\n571\\t2\\t666\\n572\\t1\\t666\\n581\\t2\\t666\\n657\\t1\\t666\\n662\\t1\\t666\\n664\\t1\\t666\\n666\\t6\\t666\\n838\\t1\\t666\\n853\\t1\\t666\\n1393\\t1\\t666\\n1428\\t1\\t666\\n1431\\t1\\t666\\n1431\\t1\\t666\\n.I 667\\n.T\\nA Mathematical Method for Analyzing the Growth of a Scientific Discipline\\n.A\\nGoffman, W.\\n.W\\n  The spread of ideas within a scientific community and the spread of infectious\\ndisease are both special cases of a general communication process.

Briefly, the concept of\\nthe CAS system consists of sets of special subject files\\nin the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2)\\nchemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4)\\napplications.  With the importance of compounds in\\ncorrelation studies, and the need to interrelate compounds\\nand the huge collections of chemical and other data, a\\nhighly developed subsystem, called the Registry System,\\nfor handling compounds must be the first step in the\\nactual operation of an over-all computer-based service.\\nThe Registry System will include files of compounds \\ninterconnected with files of associated data that permit\\nidentifying the compounds and retrieving them from the\\nfiles.\\n\\n.X\\n34\\t1\\t674\\n53\\t1\\t674\\n117\\t1\\t674\\n165\\t1\\t674\\n252\\t1\\t674\\n445\\t1\\t674\\n476\\t1\\t674\\n480\\t1\\t674\\n525\\t1\\t674\\n565\\t1\\t674\\n590\\t1\\t674\\n621\\t1\\t674\\n668\\t1\\t674\\n670\\t1\\t674\\n671\\t3\\t674\\n674\\t9\\t674\\n675\\t1\\t674\\n679\\t1\\t674\\n680\\t1\\t674\\n682\\t1\\t674\\n683\\t1\\t674\\n687\\t1\\t674\\n689\\t1\\t674\\n694\\t1\\t674\\n695\\t1\\t674\\n697\\t2\\t674\\n698\\t1\\t674\\n709\\t3\\t674\\n711\\t1\\t674\\n715\\t2\\t674\\n746\\t1\\t674\\n797\\t1\\t674\\n819\\t1\\t674\\n1077\\t1\\t674\\n1231\\t1\\t674\\n1261\\t1\\t674\\n1452\\t2\\t674\\n1452\\t2\\t674\\n.I 675\\n.T\\nAtom-by-Atom Typewriter Input for Computerized\\nStorage and Retrieval of Chemical Structures\\n.A\\nMullen, J.M.\\n.W\\n  Novel features have been added to a paper tape typewriter having a removable\\ntyping element.  A symbol set has been devised which requires only nine \\ncharacters for typing common chemical structures.  The typewriter has an uncoded\\n\"INDEX\" key which advances the paper without carriage return.  A companion key,\\n\"BACK INDEX,\" was provided which directly retracts the paper.  Both have been\\ncoded.  A tape record containing information sufficient for a computer to \\ncalculate an atom-bond connection table for a chemical structure is obtained\\nby typing the structure in any order solely from the keyboard or by use of the\\nreader with prepunched tapes containing frequently occurring substructures.\\nCost was about one-fourth that of earlier paper tape chemical typewriters.\\n\\n.X\\n668\\t1\\t675\\n674\\t1\\t675\\n675\\t5\\t675\\n678\\t1\\t675\\n679\\t1\\t675\\n704\\t1\\t675\\n709\\t1\\t675\\n709\\t1\\t675\\n.I 676\\n.T\\nISI\\'s Experiences with ASCA - A Selective Dissemination System\\n.A\\nGarfield, E.\\nSher, I.H.\\n.W\\n  ASCA (Automatic Subject Citation Alert) is a commercially available SDI\\nsystem covering the journal literature.

A study of\\nsystematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionary\\nof word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting \\nnames to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexes\\nshow that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature,\\nbut also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been written\\nwhich are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and the\\npreparation of computer programs is now under way.\\n\\n.X\\n116\\t1\\t677\\n117\\t1\\t677\\n253\\t1\\t677\\n254\\t1\\t677\\n327\\t1\\t677\\n641\\t1\\t677\\n668\\t1\\t677\\n670\\t1\\t677\\n671\\t1\\t677\\n673\\t1\\t677\\n677\\t6\\t677\\n678\\t1\\t677\\n679\\t1\\t677\\n682\\t1\\t677\\n689\\t1\\t677\\n690\\t1\\t677\\n693\\t1\\t677\\n694\\t1\\t677\\n695\\t1\\t677\\n698\\t1\\t677\\n700\\t1\\t677\\n701\\t2\\t677\\n704\\t1\\t677\\n706\\t2\\t677\\n707\\t1\\t677\\n730\\t1\\t677\\n738\\t1\\t677\\n833\\t1\\t677\\n1026\\t1\\t677\\n1072\\t1\\t677\\n1292\\t1\\t677\\n1301\\t1\\t677\\n1444\\t1\\t677\\n1452\\t2\\t677\\n1452\\t2\\t677\\n.I 678\\n.T\\nA Chemical Notation and Code for Computer Manipulation\\n.A\\nLefkovitz, D.\\n.W\\n  This paper describes and specifies the rules for generating a code to \\nrepresent chemical formulas.  It may be used either as a notation or for \\ninternal manipulation by computer for registration, screening, and atom-by-\\natom search.  It is basically a connection table in a concise format which also\\ncontains abnormality information relating to specific atoms or relations \\nbetween atoms.  The notation produced by these rules unambiguously defines\\na structure (as a connection table), but the notation is unique only to a\\ngiven numbering (or citation order) of the atoms.  Hence, its uniqueness is\\ndependent on the numbering uniqueness of the atoms in the structural formula.\\nTechniques for the use of the code in registry and substructure search are\\nalso discussed.\\n\\n.X\\n116\\t1\\t678\\n117\\t1\\t678\\n254\\t1\\t678\\n327\\t1\\t678\\n641\\t1\\t678\\n668\\t1\\t678\\n669\\t1\\t678\\n670\\t1\\t678\\n671\\t1\\t678\\n673\\t2\\t678\\n675\\t1\\t678\\n677\\t1\\t678\\n678\\t7\\t678\\n679\\t2\\t678\\n682\\t4\\t678\\n689\\t1\\t678\\n690\\t1\\t678\\n693\\t1\\t678\\n694\\t1\\t678\\n695\\t1\\t678\\n698\\t1\\t678\\n700\\t1\\t678\\n704\\t2\\t678\\n706\\t2\\t678\\n707\\t1\\t678\\n730\\t1\\t678\\n738\\t1\\t678\\n833\\t1\\t678\\n1026\\t2\\t678\\n1072\\t1\\t678\\n1292\\t1\\t678\\n1419\\t1\\t678\\n1452\\t2\\t678\\n1452\\t2\\t678\\n.I 679\\n.T\\nConversion of Wiswesser Notation to a Connectivity Matrix for Organic Compounds\\n.A\\nMatthews, F.W.\\nHyde, E.\\nThomson, L.H.\\nWiswesser, W.J.\\n.W\\n  A computer program is described which generates a connectivity matrix using\\nas input an unmodified Wiswesser notation.

The Monitor system is also considered, in this paper, as\\nan independent interim approach toward fulfilling, in an effective and economic\\nmanner, the functional requirements of a small- to medium-sized chemical \\ninformation system.

A creative index is achievable if the\\nrelationship and association of things and actions,\\none to another, can be communicated as a continuous\\nfunction vis-a-vis the real world of science and\\ntechnology.\\n  A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example,\\nethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merely\\na word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  It\\nis a concept that he associates with or relates to a\\nproduct, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, a\\nproperty, etc.  It is within the semantics of his\\nconceptual needs that he would like to use an index to \\nretrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more than\\ndocuments, however, from the index.  He wants the index\\nto direct him to those documents which are pertinent\\nto his problem.  He wants the index to help him to\\ngenerate thoughts and to suggest new combinations.\\nHe wants the index to help him in terms of his language,\\nlogic, and semantics and through a generic or specific \\napproach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants the\\nability to browse among the terms to discover the term\\nthat is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in his\\nmemory.  These are the criteria an index must satisfy\\nif it is to be a creative medium of communication. \\n.X\\n117\\t1\\t688\\n159\\t1\\t688\\n257\\t1\\t688\\n429\\t1\\t688\\n489\\t1\\t688\\n493\\t1\\t688\\n498\\t1\\t688\\n501\\t1\\t688\\n582\\t1\\t688\\n583\\t1\\t688\\n653\\t1\\t688\\n655\\t1\\t688\\n688\\t8\\t688\\n693\\t1\\t688\\n707\\t1\\t688\\n723\\t1\\t688\\n730\\t1\\t688\\n796\\t1\\t688\\n797\\t1\\t688\\n798\\t1\\t688\\n801\\t1\\t688\\n802\\t1\\t688\\n833\\t2\\t688\\n1026\\t1\\t688\\n1405\\t1\\t688\\n1452\\t1\\t688\\n1452\\t1\\t688\\n.I 689\\n.T\\nThe GREMAS System, an Integral Part of the IDC System for Chemical \\nDocumentation\\n.A\\nRossler, Sigrid\\n.A\\nKolb, Arthur\\n.W\\n   The Genealogical Retrieval by Magnetic Tapes Storage (GREMAS) system and the\\npotential it offers for searches are described..

An associated front end allows a chemist to\\ncommunicate with the programs by drawing structures on a Rand Tablet.  The\\nWLN generation programs accept connection table input, either from a previously\\nexisting file or generated from the Rand Tablet drawing.  The programs recognize\\nsituations which they cannot handle - the output is thus either correct WLN\\nor a message by which the programs acknowledge their limitations.  In general,\\ncorrect WLN will be produced for any compound containing not more than one\\nnonbenzene ring.  Work is under way to extend this to polycyclic fused ring \\nsystems.  The philosophy and concepts behind these programs are explained along\\nwith the more interesting algorithmic results.  The role of the WLN-generation\\nprograms in a developing NIH chemical information system is briefly discussed.\\nThe WLN programs are written in Fortran IV and have been developed on a \\nPDP-10 computer.\\n.X\\n116\\t1\\t694\\n117\\t1\\t694\\n254\\t1\\t694\\n316\\t1\\t694\\n327\\t1\\t694\\n641\\t1\\t694\\n668\\t1\\t694\\n670\\t1\\t694\\n671\\t1\\t694\\n673\\t1\\t694\\n674\\t1\\t694\\n677\\t1\\t694\\n678\\t1\\t694\\n679\\t1\\t694\\n682\\t2\\t694\\n689\\t1\\t694\\n690\\t3\\t694\\n693\\t1\\t694\\n694\\t7\\t694\\n695\\t4\\t694\\n697\\t2\\t694\\n698\\t4\\t694\\n700\\t1\\t694\\n704\\t1\\t694\\n706\\t1\\t694\\n707\\t1\\t694\\n730\\t1\\t694\\n738\\t1\\t694\\n833\\t1\\t694\\n1026\\t1\\t694\\n1072\\t1\\t694\\n1292\\t2\\t694\\n1452\\t3\\t694\\n1452\\t3\\t694\\n.I 695\\n.T\\nInteractive Searching of Chemical Files and Structural Diagram Generation \\nfrom Wiswesser Line Notation\\n.A\\nFeldman, R.

While remaining generally within the framework of IUPAC\\nand other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended names\\nhave been chosen.  These names are more easily derived from molecular structural\\ndiagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users.  Machine\\nediting of index names and translation of these names into structural\\nrepresentations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aided\\nby the revisions.  The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all\\n\"trivial\" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplification\\nof general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment for\\ncertain classes of substances.  Specific identifiable alloys, elementary\\nparticles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventional\\nchemical substances.  Difficulties encountered with generation of previous\\nChemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisons\\nare made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituent\\nradicals.\\n.X\\n677\\t2\\t701\\n701\\t5\\t701\\n709\\t1\\t701\\n738\\t1\\t701\\n738\\t1\\t701\\n.I 702\\n.T\\nThe CA Integrated Subject File.

Most of these\\nsystems are also capable of handling certain fragment\\nrequests; however, the fragments which can be processed\\nare frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in\\nretrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only\\nthose fragments which are explicit in the cipher are\\nreadily detected.  To allow a completely general \\nspecification of fragments it seems inevitable that a\\ndetailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query\\nand library structures.  A technique for making such detailed\\ncomparisons is presented in this report.  This technique\\nis novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad\\nrestarting required by other atom-by-atom matching\\nprocedures.\\n  Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,\\nsome definitions are reviewed and a brief example is\\npresented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow\\ndiagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional\\nexamples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for\\na digital computer is discussed.\\n  This report is a condensed version of the original, which\\ngives a generalization and comprehensive description of\\nthe algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,\\nand applications other than chemical retrieval systems.\\n.X\\n116\\t1\\t706\\n117\\t1\\t706\\n253\\t1\\t706\\n254\\t1\\t706\\n327\\t3\\t706\\n568\\t2\\t706\\n569\\t1\\t706\\n641\\t1\\t706\\n668\\t1\\t706\\n669\\t1\\t706\\n670\\t1\\t706\\n671\\t2\\t706\\n673\\t1\\t706\\n677\\t2\\t706\\n678\\t2\\t706\\n679\\t1\\t706\\n682\\t1\\t706\\n689\\t1\\t706\\n690\\t1\\t706\\n693\\t1\\t706\\n694\\t1\\t706\\n695\\t1\\t706\\n698\\t1\\t706\\n700\\t1\\t706\\n704\\t1\\t706\\n706\\t10\\t706\\n707\\t1\\t706\\n730\\t1\\t706\\n738\\t1\\t706\\n833\\t1\\t706\\n890\\t3\\t706\\n1026\\t2\\t706\\n1072\\t1\\t706\\n1092\\t1\\t706\\n1202\\t1\\t706\\n1292\\t2\\t706\\n1301\\t1\\t706\\n1444\\t1\\t706\\n1452\\t2\\t706\\n1452\\t2\\t706\\n.I 707\\n.T\\nFrench National Policy for Chemical Information and the DARC System \\nas a Potential Tool of This Policy\\n.A\\nDubois, J.

I. General Design\\n.A\\nDittmar, P.G.\\nStobaugh, R.E.\\nWatson, C.E.\\n.W\\n  The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System is a computer-\\nbased system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis of\\ncomposition and structure.  Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone\\ninput, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic\\nchemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased\\nto include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been\\nintegrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system,\\nRegistry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major\\nchanges in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques\\nfor registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms \\nand bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately \\nidentified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each\\nsubstance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature\\nderivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The general\\ndesign of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic\\nsegments, is presented.\\n.X\\n422\\t1\\t709\\n577\\t1\\t709\\n641\\t1\\t709\\n643\\t1\\t709\\n644\\t1\\t709\\n645\\t1\\t709\\n649\\t1\\t709\\n650\\t1\\t709\\n670\\t1\\t709\\n671\\t2\\t709\\n674\\t3\\t709\\n675\\t1\\t709\\n700\\t1\\t709\\n701\\t1\\t709\\n708\\t1\\t709\\n709\\t8\\t709\\n731\\t1\\t709\\n738\\t2\\t709\\n755\\t1\\t709\\n825\\t1\\t709\\n830\\t1\\t709\\n1261\\t1\\t709\\n1292\\t1\\t709\\n1292\\t1\\t709\\n.I 710\\n.T\\nAn International Mass Spectral Search System (MSSS).

User acceptance of this microfilm application has been greatly       \\nimproved by loading the file into cartridges and making use of motor-driven\\nreader-printers.  This equipment permits rapid searching of the microfilm\\nand adds the convenience of on-the-spot hard-copy prints as needed.  Of prime  \\nimportance are the economic advantages of these editions, since they allow many\\nspecial libraries to stretch greatly the space available to them for journal\\nhousing.  The economics of this approach are also discussed, as are the \\nreactions of the scientists and information personnel who use them.\\n.X\\n91\\t1\\t721\\n286\\t2\\t721\\n429\\t1\\t721\\n513\\t1\\t721\\n582\\t1\\t721\\n588\\t1\\t721\\n589\\t1\\t721\\n603\\t1\\t721\\n613\\t1\\t721\\n614\\t1\\t721\\n618\\t1\\t721\\n657\\t1\\t721\\n672\\t2\\t721\\n685\\t2\\t721\\n686\\t2\\t721\\n691\\t2\\t721\\n721\\t5\\t721\\n722\\t1\\t721\\n724\\t2\\t721\\n725\\t2\\t721\\n765\\t1\\t721\\n770\\t1\\t721\\n776\\t1\\t721\\n958\\t1\\t721\\n987\\t1\\t721\\n988\\t1\\t721\\n1014\\t2\\t721\\n1058\\t1\\t721\\n1208\\t2\\t721\\n1209\\t1\\t721\\n1290\\t1\\t721\\n1293\\t1\\t721\\n1302\\t1\\t721\\n1352\\t1\\t721\\n1352\\t1\\t721\\n.I 722\\n.T\\nInformation Transfer Limitations of Titles of Chemical Documents\\n.A\\nBottle, R.R.\\nSeeley, C.R.\\n.W\\n  Some methods of estimating the minimum amounts of information in a document\\nnot retrievable through its title are discussed.  An analysis of the information\\ntransferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search\\nstrategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles\\nare not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used\\nas synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal\\narticles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than \\nthose of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely \\nuninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistry\\nare more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting\\nand other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the\\nunderlying information transfer principles.\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t722\\n34\\t1\\t722\\n38\\t2\\t722\\n49\\t1\\t722\\n52\\t2\\t722\\n53\\t1\\t722\\n59\\t1\\t722\\n88\\t1\\t722\\n89\\t1\\t722\\n91\\t1\\t722\\n150\\t2\\t722\\n164\\t1\\t722\\n202\\t1\\t722\\n213\\t1\\t722\\n224\\t1\\t722\\n243\\t1\\t722\\n384\\t1\\t722\\n421\\t1\\t722\\n429\\t3\\t722\\n465\\t1\\t722\\n466\\t1\\t722\\n490\\t1\\t722\\n491\\t1\\t722\\n506\\t1\\t722\\n507\\t1\\t722\\n510\\t2\\t722\\n512\\t1\\t722\\n513\\t2\\t722\\n560\\t1\\t722\\n582\\t3\\t722\\n588\\t1\\t722\\n589\\t4\\t722\\n591\\t1\\t722\\n595\\t1\\t722\\n603\\t4\\t722\\n604\\t1\\t722\\n613\\t1\\t722\\n614\\t1\\t722\\n618\\t1\\t722\\n622\\t1\\t722\\n623\\t1\\t722\\n629\\t1\\t722\\n633\\t1\\t722\\n639\\t1\\t722\\n657\\t1\\t722\\n659\\t1\\t722\\n676\\t1\\t722\\n685\\t1\\t722\\n686\\t1\\t722\\n691\\t1\\t722\\n711\\t1\\t722\\n721\\t1\\t722\\n722\\t7\\t722\\n723\\t1\\t722\\n724\\t1\\t722\\n725\\t1\\t722\\n726\\t1\\t722\\n728\\t1\\t722\\n730\\t1\\t722\\n731\\t1\\t722\\n732\\t1\\t722\\n770\\t1\\t722\\n776\\t1\\t722\\n809\\t1\\t722\\n810\\t1\\t722\\n813\\t1\\t722\\n814\\t1\\t722\\n820\\t1\\t722\\n822\\t1\\t722\\n828\\t1\\t722\\n830\\t1\\t722\\n870\\t1\\t722\\n879\\t1\\t722\\n958\\t1\\t722\\n987\\t1\\t722\\n988\\t1\\t722\\n1030\\t1\\t722\\n1091\\t1\\t722\\n1144\\t1\\t722\\n1195\\t2\\t722\\n1208\\t1\\t722\\n1256\\t1\\t722\\n1283\\t1\\t722\\n1293\\t1\\t722\\n1298\\t1\\t722\\n1299\\t1\\t722\\n1302\\t1\\t722\\n1363\\t1\\t722\\n1366\\t1\\t722\\n1367\\t1\\t722\\n1368\\t1\\t722\\n1396\\t1\\t722\\n1421\\t1\\t722\\n1421\\t1\\t722\\n.I 723\\n.T\\nThe Development, Cost, and Impact of a Current Awareness Service in an\\nIndustrial Town\\n.A\\nBowman, C.M.\\nBrown, M.T.\\n.W\\n  The development of a current awareness system in The Dow Chemical Company \\nhas resulted in four established services, one based on internal information and\\nthe other three on Chemical Abstracts.

The survey results indicate\\nthat the dissemination services are being used by a large portion of the\\nfaculty and the graduate students within the University System of Georgia,\\nwith an average of 3 to 5 people seeing the bibliography from each search\\nquestion.  Over 97% of the respondees indicated some or substantial\\ncontribution to their professional activities, with the major contributions \\nbeing a savings or more efficient use of time and broadened subject\\ncoverage.  The users indicated several changes in library use habits as a\\nresult of the computer-based searches, among them more direct access to the\\nprimary literature and increased use of library resources as they had been\\nmade aware of new sources and media - e.g., microforms.

In an earlier\\npaper, we described the development of an experimental\\nselective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) service\\nbased on these tapes.  A detailed description of the\\ntechniques of profile construction for searching a\\nWiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given in\\nthis earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluation\\nof the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measures\\nof retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also of\\nuser reactions to the service, as expressed in their replies\\nto a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used to\\nidentify the reasons for retrieval failures and possible\\nmethods for improving retrieval performance.

For purposes of\\ncomparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is\\nrepresented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  The\\nresults of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4.\\nThe reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  About\\nhalf of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers\\npublished in the 1950\\'s.  This, in part, reflects the\\npresent highly vigorous state of chemical investigation\\nand its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another striking\\nfact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical\\nSociety, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work\\npublished in the journal itself.  In Industrial and\\nEngineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations\\nis 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the fact\\nthat writers who habitually publish in a particular\\njournal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seems\\nto reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these\\njournals in their respective fields.  More than 38%\\nof the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry\\nare to various American Chemical Society publications.\\nIn the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than\\n45% of the citations are to Society publications.\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t735\\n36\\t1\\t735\\n37\\t1\\t735\\n41\\t1\\t735\\n76\\t1\\t735\\n89\\t3\\t735\\n97\\t1\\t735\\n102\\t1\\t735\\n111\\t1\\t735\\n112\\t1\\t735\\n163\\t1\\t735\\n183\\t2\\t735\\n184\\t2\\t735\\n193\\t2\\t735\\n198\\t3\\t735\\n199\\t1\\t735\\n201\\t1\\t735\\n203\\t1\\t735\\n204\\t1\\t735\\n210\\t1\\t735\\n225\\t1\\t735\\n255\\t1\\t735\\n269\\t1\\t735\\n373\\t1\\t735\\n379\\t1\\t735\\n473\\t1\\t735\\n543\\t1\\t735\\n545\\t1\\t735\\n552\\t2\\t735\\n587\\t1\\t735\\n588\\t1\\t735\\n592\\t1\\t735\\n605\\t1\\t735\\n613\\t1\\t735\\n614\\t2\\t735\\n616\\t1\\t735\\n638\\t2\\t735\\n685\\t1\\t735\\n716\\t1\\t735\\n735\\t7\\t735\\n747\\t1\\t735\\n750\\t1\\t735\\n753\\t1\\t735\\n766\\t2\\t735\\n767\\t1\\t735\\n775\\t2\\t735\\n782\\t1\\t735\\n784\\t3\\t735\\n788\\t1\\t735\\n789\\t1\\t735\\n793\\t1\\t735\\n800\\t1\\t735\\n808\\t1\\t735\\n821\\t1\\t735\\n828\\t1\\t735\\n905\\t1\\t735\\n907\\t1\\t735\\n952\\t1\\t735\\n953\\t1\\t735\\n977\\t1\\t735\\n983\\t1\\t735\\n1016\\t1\\t735\\n1023\\t1\\t735\\n1030\\t1\\t735\\n1055\\t2\\t735\\n1087\\t2\\t735\\n1089\\t1\\t735\\n1090\\t1\\t735\\n1135\\t1\\t735\\n1209\\t1\\t735\\n1210\\t1\\t735\\n1260\\t2\\t735\\n1275\\t4\\t735\\n1276\\t2\\t735\\n1278\\t1\\t735\\n1280\\t1\\t735\\n1283\\t1\\t735\\n1285\\t2\\t735\\n1286\\t1\\t735\\n1287\\t1\\t735\\n1290\\t1\\t735\\n1298\\t1\\t735\\n1302\\t3\\t735\\n1335\\t1\\t735\\n1355\\t1\\t735\\n1390\\t1\\t735\\n1397\\t2\\t735\\n1417\\t1\\t735\\n1428\\t1\\t735\\n1432\\t2\\t735\\n1432\\t2\\t735\\n.I 736\\n.T\\nOverview of the NAS/NRC Conference on Large Data Bases\\n.A\\nWilliams, M.E.\\n.W\\n  In 1971 the Committee on Chemical Information of the\\nNational Academy of Sciences, National Research Council,\\nrecognized the problem of large data bases and accordingly\\ncreated a subcommittee to investigate the problem and its\\nimpact on chemical information.\\n  The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee was\\nto survey organizations that generate and/or process large\\ndata bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways in\\nwhich one can view a data base as being large.

It then\\naddresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorily\\nresolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under active\\ninvestigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One is\\ncalled the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique\\ncalled super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has \\nrecently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics related\\nto file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational\\ncost and performance statistics are not yet available.\\n.X\\n62\\t1\\t737\\n125\\t1\\t737\\n127\\t2\\t737\\n129\\t1\\t737\\n310\\t1\\t737\\n318\\t1\\t737\\n363\\t2\\t737\\n409\\t1\\t737\\n432\\t1\\t737\\n460\\t1\\t737\\n461\\t1\\t737\\n462\\t1\\t737\\n580\\t1\\t737\\n604\\t1\\t737\\n622\\t1\\t737\\n642\\t1\\t737\\n643\\t2\\t737\\n644\\t2\\t737\\n645\\t1\\t737\\n646\\t1\\t737\\n649\\t1\\t737\\n650\\t1\\t737\\n670\\t1\\t737\\n690\\t1\\t737\\n699\\t2\\t737\\n700\\t2\\t737\\n708\\t2\\t737\\n736\\t1\\t737\\n737\\t5\\t737\\n738\\t1\\t737\\n739\\t1\\t737\\n741\\t1\\t737\\n853\\t1\\t737\\n875\\t1\\t737\\n883\\t1\\t737\\n1044\\t1\\t737\\n1274\\t1\\t737\\n1374\\t1\\t737\\n1376\\t1\\t737\\n1419\\t1\\t737\\n1419\\t1\\t737\\n.I 738\\n.T\\nSubstructure Searching of Computer-Readable Chemical Abstracts\\nService Ninth Collective Index Nomenclature Files\\n.A\\nFisanick, W.\\nMitchell, L.D.\\nScott, J.A.\\nVander Stouw, G.G.\\n.W\\n  The increasing availability of computer-readable files of chemical  \\nnomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the development\\nof methods for performing substructure searches in which CA nomenclature\\nterms are used as search terms.  Substructure searches on CA Index\\nnomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological\\nsearches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of\\nsearches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also contain\\nnonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance data\\ncan often be done within a single search of a file with both high recall\\nand relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possible\\nfor persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to construct\\nnomenclature profiles for many questions.\\n.X\\n116\\t1\\t738\\n117\\t1\\t738\\n124\\t1\\t738\\n125\\t1\\t738\\n127\\t2\\t738\\n129\\t2\\t738\\n190\\t1\\t738\\n191\\t1\\t738\\n197\\t1\\t738\\n211\\t1\\t738\\n214\\t1\\t738\\n218\\t1\\t738\\n243\\t1\\t738\\n254\\t1\\t738\\n307\\t1\\t738\\n327\\t1\\t738\\n330\\t1\\t738\\n363\\t1\\t738\\n378\\t1\\t738\\n432\\t1\\t738\\n450\\t1\\t738\\n451\\t1\\t738\\n452\\t1\\t738\\n459\\t1\\t738\\n460\\t1\\t738\\n461\\t1\\t738\\n468\\t1\\t738\\n484\\t1\\t738\\n492\\t1\\t738\\n508\\t1\\t738\\n511\\t1\\t738\\n512\\t1\\t738\\n514\\t1\\t738\\n518\\t1\\t738\\n520\\t1\\t738\\n523\\t1\\t738\\n524\\t1\\t738\\n525\\t1\\t738\\n526\\t1\\t738\\n529\\t1\\t738\\n530\\t1\\t738\\n534\\t1\\t738\\n546\\t1\\t738\\n553\\t1\\t738\\n579\\t1\\t738\\n580\\t1\\t738\\n594\\t1\\t738\\n603\\t1\\t738\\n604\\t1\\t738\\n606\\t1\\t738\\n609\\t1\\t738\\n610\\t1\\t738\\n611\\t1\\t738\\n612\\t1\\t738\\n622\\t1\\t738\\n625\\t1\\t738\\n626\\t1\\t738\\n630\\t1\\t738\\n636\\t1\\t738\\n637\\t1\\t738\\n641\\t1\\t738\\n642\\t2\\t738\\n643\\t1\\t738\\n644\\t1\\t738\\n645\\t1\\t738\\n646\\t1\\t738\\n648\\t1\\t738\\n649\\t1\\t738\\n650\\t2\\t738\\n668\\t1\\t738\\n670\\t1\\t738\\n671\\t1\\t738\\n673\\t1\\t738\\n677\\t1\\t738\\n678\\t1\\t738\\n679\\t1\\t738\\n682\\t1\\t738\\n689\\t1\\t738\\n690\\t1\\t738\\n692\\t1\\t738\\n693\\t1\\t738\\n694\\t1\\t738\\n695\\t1\\t738\\n696\\t1\\t738\\n698\\t1\\t738\\n699\\t2\\t738\\n700\\t2\\t738\\n701\\t1\\t738\\n702\\t2\\t738\\n703\\t1\\t738\\n704\\t1\\t738\\n705\\t1\\t738\\n706\\t1\\t738\\n707\\t2\\t738\\n708\\t2\\t738\\n709\\t2\\t738\\n710\\t1\\t738\\n726\\t1\\t738\\n727\\t1\\t738\\n728\\t1\\t738\\n730\\t1\\t738\\n731\\t2\\t738\\n732\\t1\\t738\\n733\\t2\\t738\\n734\\t2\\t738\\n736\\t2\\t738\\n737\\t1\\t738\\n738\\t8\\t738\\n739\\t2\\t738\\n740\\t1\\t738\\n741\\t3\\t738\\n742\\t2\\t738\\n743\\t1\\t738\\n744\\t1\\t738\\n755\\t1\\t738\\n820\\t1\\t738\\n826\\t1\\t738\\n827\\t1\\t738\\n833\\t1\\t738\\n879\\t1\\t738\\n883\\t1\\t738\\n1004\\t1\\t738\\n1026\\t1\\t738\\n1035\\t1\\t738\\n1072\\t1\\t738\\n1078\\t1\\t738\\n1089\\t1\\t738\\n1091\\t1\\t738\\n1207\\t1\\t738\\n1264\\t1\\t738\\n1292\\t1\\t738\\n1297\\t1\\t738\\n1303\\t1\\t738\\n1356\\t1\\t738\\n1364\\t1\\t738\\n1368\\t1\\t738\\n1370\\t1\\t738\\n1372\\t1\\t738\\n1373\\t1\\t738\\n1374\\t2\\t738\\n1375\\t1\\t738\\n1376\\t2\\t738\\n1377\\t1\\t738\\n1448\\t1\\t738\\n1452\\t1\\t738\\n1452\\t1\\t738\\n.I 739\\n.T\\nA Rapid Generalized Minicomputer Text Search System Incorporating Algebraic\\nEntry of Boolean Strategies\\n.A\\nIsenhour, T.

A.\\n.W\\n   A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very, \\nmore or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator \\nwhich acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. For\\nexample, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts\\non the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man..\\n   To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several\\nelementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may\\nbe built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate \\nrepresentation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as \\ncomplementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast\\nintensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..\\n   Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, \\ne.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated\\nby an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, \\ne.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is \\nmore  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components \\nof its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge \\nrequires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its \\noperand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it\\nfalls into category I or II..\\n   The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for \\nseveral relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly,\\netc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, \\nrequire the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more \\nqualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..\\n.X\\n61\\t1\\t745\\n175\\t2\\t745\\n310\\t1\\t745\\n318\\t1\\t745\\n397\\t3\\t745\\n417\\t3\\t745\\n430\\t4\\t745\\n443\\t4\\t745\\n455\\t6\\t745\\n464\\t3\\t745\\n745\\t6\\t745\\n1204\\t3\\t745\\n1398\\t4\\t745\\n1427\\t3\\t745\\n1427\\t3\\t745\\n.I 746\\n.T\\nSubject Indexes and Automatic Document Retrieval\\n.A\\nLynch, Michael F.\\n.W\\n   Index entries from the subject indexes to CA can, in general, be converted\\nto \\'normal\\' or title-like phrases by applying simple tests to the positions of\\nprepositions and conjunctions in the entries..

The present \\npaper shows that the Bradford distribution is closely related to the Zipf\\ndistribution.. It requires data on only the most productive journals, is\\nmathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of\\nthe \\'completeness\\' of a search is accepted.. For comparability of results, \\ncertain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of \\njournals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested..\\n   It is found, however, that a modified form of the Bradford distribution is \\nrequired when Bradford-type collections of journals are merged into large\\ncollections, when \\'saturation\\' of the most productive journals occurs..\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t748\\n24\\t1\\t748\\n31\\t1\\t748\\n33\\t1\\t748\\n36\\t1\\t748\\n37\\t1\\t748\\n39\\t1\\t748\\n40\\t1\\t748\\n44\\t1\\t748\\n47\\t1\\t748\\n48\\t1\\t748\\n49\\t1\\t748\\n54\\t1\\t748\\n55\\t2\\t748\\n57\\t2\\t748\\n62\\t1\\t748\\n65\\t1\\t748\\n66\\t1\\t748\\n71\\t1\\t748\\n72\\t1\\t748\\n73\\t1\\t748\\n74\\t1\\t748\\n75\\t2\\t748\\n76\\t2\\t748\\n77\\t1\\t748\\n78\\t1\\t748\\n79\\t1\\t748\\n81\\t2\\t748\\n82\\t1\\t748\\n83\\t1\\t748\\n86\\t1\\t748\\n88\\t1\\t748\\n97\\t1\\t748\\n102\\t2\\t748\\n103\\t2\\t748\\n128\\t1\\t748\\n137\\t1\\t748\\n153\\t1\\t748\\n156\\t1\\t748\\n162\\t1\\t748\\n167\\t2\\t748\\n181\\t1\\t748\\n184\\t1\\t748\\n189\\t1\\t748\\n193\\t1\\t748\\n195\\t1\\t748\\n201\\t2\\t748\\n203\\t1\\t748\\n204\\t1\\t748\\n205\\t1\\t748\\n206\\t1\\t748\\n207\\t1\\t748\\n208\\t1\\t748\\n210\\t2\\t748\\n211\\t1\\t748\\n212\\t1\\t748\\n217\\t1\\t748\\n219\\t1\\t748\\n221\\t1\\t748\\n225\\t1\\t748\\n233\\t4\\t748\\n245\\t1\\t748\\n253\\t1\\t748\\n267\\t2\\t748\\n277\\t1\\t748\\n278\\t1\\t748\\n279\\t2\\t748\\n280\\t2\\t748\\n313\\t1\\t748\\n314\\t1\\t748\\n330\\t1\\t748\\n359\\t10\\t748\\n373\\t1\\t748\\n377\\t1\\t748\\n378\\t1\\t748\\n379\\t5\\t748\\n386\\t1\\t748\\n395\\t3\\t748\\n398\\t1\\t748\\n415\\t1\\t748\\n416\\t1\\t748\\n465\\t1\\t748\\n475\\t1\\t748\\n480\\t1\\t748\\n486\\t1\\t748\\n505\\t3\\t748\\n515\\t1\\t748\\n560\\t1\\t748\\n573\\t3\\t748\\n587\\t1\\t748\\n614\\t3\\t748\\n616\\t1\\t748\\n618\\t2\\t748\\n623\\t1\\t748\\n625\\t1\\t748\\n632\\t1\\t748\\n634\\t1\\t748\\n635\\t3\\t748\\n638\\t2\\t748\\n651\\t1\\t748\\n658\\t1\\t748\\n667\\t2\\t748\\n714\\t1\\t748\\n716\\t1\\t748\\n720\\t1\\t748\\n729\\t1\\t748\\n744\\t2\\t748\\n748\\t31\\t748\\n749\\t1\\t748\\n750\\t1\\t748\\n751\\t7\\t748\\n753\\t1\\t748\\n756\\t2\\t748\\n757\\t2\\t748\\n759\\t3\\t748\\n764\\t1\\t748\\n765\\t8\\t748\\n767\\t3\\t748\\n775\\t1\\t748\\n777\\t1\\t748\\n778\\t13\\t748\\n782\\t2\\t748\\n785\\t1\\t748\\n786\\t3\\t748\\n787\\t6\\t748\\n788\\t2\\t748\\n789\\t2\\t748\\n791\\t8\\t748\\n792\\t2\\t748\\n793\\t2\\t748\\n800\\t3\\t748\\n804\\t2\\t748\\n805\\t1\\t748\\n811\\t1\\t748\\n821\\t1\\t748\\n831\\t2\\t748\\n837\\t1\\t748\\n889\\t2\\t748\\n891\\t1\\t748\\n893\\t5\\t748\\n905\\t1\\t748\\n925\\t3\\t748\\n948\\t1\\t748\\n952\\t3\\t748\\n953\\t1\\t748\\n983\\t1\\t748\\n984\\t1\\t748\\n1016\\t3\\t748\\n1019\\t2\\t748\\n1030\\t1\\t748\\n1061\\t1\\t748\\n1071\\t1\\t748\\n1081\\t2\\t748\\n1082\\t2\\t748\\n1083\\t7\\t748\\n1085\\t8\\t748\\n1086\\t5\\t748\\n1087\\t1\\t748\\n1090\\t1\\t748\\n1114\\t1\\t748\\n1122\\t1\\t748\\n1123\\t1\\t748\\n1173\\t1\\t748\\n1182\\t5\\t748\\n1200\\t1\\t748\\n1201\\t3\\t748\\n1203\\t1\\t748\\n1210\\t1\\t748\\n1254\\t1\\t748\\n1256\\t1\\t748\\n1260\\t1\\t748\\n1274\\t1\\t748\\n1275\\t2\\t748\\n1277\\t1\\t748\\n1278\\t3\\t748\\n1279\\t1\\t748\\n1280\\t1\\t748\\n1287\\t1\\t748\\n1301\\t1\\t748\\n1302\\t4\\t748\\n1304\\t1\\t748\\n1313\\t1\\t748\\n1338\\t1\\t748\\n1341\\t1\\t748\\n1344\\t1\\t748\\n1347\\t1\\t748\\n1361\\t1\\t748\\n1369\\t1\\t748\\n1373\\t1\\t748\\n1375\\t1\\t748\\n1376\\t1\\t748\\n1380\\t1\\t748\\n1400\\t1\\t748\\n1401\\t1\\t748\\n1404\\t1\\t748\\n1417\\t1\\t748\\n1418\\t4\\t748\\n1422\\t1\\t748\\n1428\\t1\\t748\\n1444\\t1\\t748\\n1444\\t1\\t748\\n.I 749\\n.T\\nStatistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?\\n.A\\nPritchard, A.\\n.W\\n  The term statistical bibliography seems to have been first used by E.\\nWyndham Hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the Sandars Reader\\nin bibliography at the University of Cambridge.

The idea of this was certainly not\\nnew; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and\\nABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not-\\nOnly (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising from\\nCranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked.\\nIn reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the\\nsimple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results\\ncoming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made\\nfurther modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward\\nto read as follows: \\'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of\\nsubsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected\\ndecreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,\\nthere is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results\\nof a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, has\\nfour qualifications to the basic statement.\\n.X\\n28\\t1\\t752\\n57\\t1\\t752\\n73\\t3\\t752\\n75\\t1\\t752\\n79\\t1\\t752\\n134\\t1\\t752\\n146\\t1\\t752\\n157\\t1\\t752\\n175\\t2\\t752\\n194\\t1\\t752\\n224\\t1\\t752\\n274\\t1\\t752\\n298\\t1\\t752\\n315\\t1\\t752\\n381\\t2\\t752\\n382\\t1\\t752\\n389\\t3\\t752\\n390\\t4\\t752\\n419\\t1\\t752\\n441\\t1\\t752\\n445\\t1\\t752\\n447\\t1\\t752\\n449\\t1\\t752\\n456\\t1\\t752\\n458\\t2\\t752\\n468\\t1\\t752\\n509\\t1\\t752\\n514\\t3\\t752\\n518\\t1\\t752\\n531\\t1\\t752\\n554\\t1\\t752\\n575\\t2\\t752\\n577\\t2\\t752\\n579\\t1\\t752\\n591\\t1\\t752\\n595\\t2\\t752\\n599\\t1\\t752\\n603\\t1\\t752\\n615\\t2\\t752\\n619\\t1\\t752\\n620\\t1\\t752\\n621\\t1\\t752\\n625\\t3\\t752\\n630\\t1\\t752\\n634\\t1\\t752\\n639\\t1\\t752\\n643\\t1\\t752\\n644\\t2\\t752\\n646\\t1\\t752\\n649\\t2\\t752\\n652\\t1\\t752\\n660\\t2\\t752\\n752\\t11\\t752\\n754\\t1\\t752\\n780\\t5\\t752\\n785\\t4\\t752\\n795\\t1\\t752\\n806\\t1\\t752\\n812\\t3\\t752\\n820\\t1\\t752\\n822\\t2\\t752\\n824\\t1\\t752\\n827\\t1\\t752\\n829\\t2\\t752\\n830\\t1\\t752\\n895\\t2\\t752\\n907\\t1\\t752\\n956\\t1\\t752\\n1044\\t1\\t752\\n1091\\t1\\t752\\n1255\\t2\\t752\\n1282\\t4\\t752\\n1294\\t1\\t752\\n1307\\t1\\t752\\n1327\\t1\\t752\\n1327\\t1\\t752\\n.I 753\\n.T\\nSource of Citations and References for Analysis Purposes: \\nA Comparative Assessment \\n.A\\nBrittain, J.

E. L.\\n.W\\n   A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a \\ndiscussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the \\nonly knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from \\nempirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification..\\nItems of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates,\\nand the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four\\nbasic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and\\ncausation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a\\nlinear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations\\nof such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of \\nthe first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,\\nand possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be\\nconstructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..\\nThe nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an\\ninductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the\\nstructure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique\\nfor accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with\\ncomplete flexibility..\\n.X\\n160\\t1\\t758\\n258\\t1\\t758\\n259\\t1\\t758\\n476\\t1\\t758\\n477\\t1\\t758\\n478\\t2\\t758\\n480\\t2\\t758\\n516\\t2\\t758\\n542\\t1\\t758\\n758\\t5\\t758\\n785\\t1\\t758\\n1215\\t1\\t758\\n1231\\t1\\t758\\n1259\\t1\\t758\\n1391\\t2\\t758\\n1405\\t1\\t758\\n1405\\t1\\t758\\n.I 759\\n.T\\nA New Look at Reference Scattering\\n.A\\nCole, P.F.\\n.W\\n  It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journal\\nreferences on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a small\\nproportion of the total titles.  Bradford listed the journals concerned in order\\nof decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative\\ntotals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced,\\nhe obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many later\\nworkers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution\\nof references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of\\nliterature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these results\\nBradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference\\nscattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this \\'law of scattering\\' predicted\\nnot a straight line but a curve.  Kendall has now provided a more refined\\nstatistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford.\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t759\\n36\\t1\\t759\\n44\\t1\\t759\\n46\\t1\\t759\\n57\\t2\\t759\\n76\\t1\\t759\\n81\\t1\\t759\\n184\\t1\\t759\\n193\\t1\\t759\\n195\\t1\\t759\\n201\\t1\\t759\\n203\\t1\\t759\\n204\\t1\\t759\\n205\\t1\\t759\\n233\\t1\\t759\\n267\\t1\\t759\\n359\\t5\\t759\\n361\\t3\\t759\\n367\\t1\\t759\\n395\\t1\\t759\\n416\\t2\\t759\\n505\\t1\\t759\\n515\\t1\\t759\\n573\\t1\\t759\\n587\\t1\\t759\\n616\\t1\\t759\\n667\\t1\\t759\\n748\\t3\\t759\\n750\\t1\\t759\\n751\\t2\\t759\\n759\\t12\\t759\\n760\\t1\\t759\\n765\\t7\\t759\\n767\\t2\\t759\\n775\\t2\\t759\\n776\\t3\\t759\\n778\\t4\\t759\\n787\\t2\\t759\\n791\\t1\\t759\\n792\\t1\\t759\\n793\\t1\\t759\\n800\\t1\\t759\\n893\\t1\\t759\\n977\\t1\\t759\\n983\\t1\\t759\\n1016\\t1\\t759\\n1030\\t1\\t759\\n1076\\t1\\t759\\n1081\\t2\\t759\\n1082\\t2\\t759\\n1083\\t3\\t759\\n1085\\t2\\t759\\n1086\\t1\\t759\\n1090\\t1\\t759\\n1097\\t1\\t759\\n1098\\t1\\t759\\n1114\\t1\\t759\\n1122\\t1\\t759\\n1157\\t1\\t759\\n1170\\t2\\t759\\n1173\\t1\\t759\\n1182\\t4\\t759\\n1201\\t2\\t759\\n1226\\t1\\t759\\n1275\\t1\\t759\\n1278\\t1\\t759\\n1381\\t1\\t759\\n1401\\t1\\t759\\n1417\\t1\\t759\\n1418\\t1\\t759\\n1432\\t1\\t759\\n1432\\t1\\t759\\n.I 760\\n.T\\nThe Foreign-Language Problem Facing Scientists and Technologists \\nin the United Kingdom - Report of a Recent Survey\\n.A\\nWood, D.

To obtain quantitative data on \\nthese points the NLL has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and\\nlibrarians in the United Kingdom and the present paper presents the more\\nimportant results..\\n   The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude\\nand is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languages\\ncreating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also \\nindicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and \\nthat, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are \\nlargely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their \\ndifficulties..\\n   The results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which \\nthe appropriate authorities might follow..

This paper discusses\\nthe variable of \\'implicit use orientations\\' - the particular attitude taken by\\na subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and forty\\njudges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information \\nrequirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each \\nadopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It\\nwas found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked \\neffect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use \\norientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that\\ntheir study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which\\none person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of \\nanother..\\n   Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to\\nevaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgements\\nhave usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to \\ncritical scrutiny..

Some comparisons and conclusions are certainly much\\nless sound than the casual reader might suppose, particularly when results\\nhave been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey.\\nThe difficulty of comparing information-use surveys is well illustrated by\\nthe copious footnotes used by Menzel, Lieberman, and Dulchin in order to\\nqualify the significance of the results which they compare.\\n.X\\n14\\t1\\t772\\n41\\t1\\t772\\n132\\t2\\t772\\n137\\t2\\t772\\n147\\t1\\t772\\n161\\t2\\t772\\n237\\t1\\t772\\n272\\t1\\t772\\n456\\t1\\t772\\n624\\t1\\t772\\n760\\t1\\t772\\n763\\t1\\t772\\n767\\t1\\t772\\n772\\t6\\t772\\n900\\t1\\t772\\n952\\t1\\t772\\n965\\t1\\t772\\n1030\\t1\\t772\\n1095\\t1\\t772\\n1155\\t1\\t772\\n1156\\t1\\t772\\n1158\\t1\\t772\\n1160\\t1\\t772\\n1254\\t1\\t772\\n1275\\t1\\t772\\n1280\\t1\\t772\\n1353\\t1\\t772\\n1361\\t1\\t772\\n1361\\t1\\t772\\n.I 773\\n.T\\nA Computer_Aided Information Service for Nuclear Science and Technology\\n.A\\nRolling, Loll N.\\n.W\\n   The computerized information centre of the European Atomic Energy Community\\nhas become operational..

A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and the\\nresults are reported here.\\n   Our results are presented below in the following form:\\n1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references,\\n   reports, etc.).\\n2. Abstracts journals consulted.\\n3. Coverage and multiple coverage.  This is a bar-chart showing number of\\n   references not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on.\\n4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last column\\n   showing coverage by all services combined.

W.\\n.A\\nClimenson, W. D.\\n.W\\n   A retrieval system may be evaluated strictly in terms of user satisfaction\\n(operating efficiency), or it may be evaluated from the point of view of\\nefficient means of satisfying user requirements (economic efficiency).. When\\nwe consider the relationship between operating efficiency and economic \\nefficiency, we are faced with a whole series of possible trade-offs.. There\\nmay be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs..\\nThe problem is to determine the most economical path to follow.. Pay-off\\nfactors, break-even points, and diminishing returns must be taken into \\nconsideration.. This paper considers some of these factors in relation to various\\nparts of the complete retrieval system: the acquisition subsystem, the indexing \\nsubsystem, the index language, the searching subsystem, and the equipment \\nsubsystem..\\n.X\\n61\\t1\\t779\\n62\\t1\\t779\\n65\\t1\\t779\\n67\\t1\\t779\\n70\\t1\\t779\\n71\\t1\\t779\\n72\\t1\\t779\\n73\\t1\\t779\\n75\\t1\\t779\\n76\\t1\\t779\\n135\\t1\\t779\\n153\\t2\\t779\\n156\\t1\\t779\\n175\\t2\\t779\\n206\\t1\\t779\\n207\\t1\\t779\\n208\\t1\\t779\\n213\\t1\\t779\\n214\\t1\\t779\\n217\\t1\\t779\\n243\\t1\\t779\\n249\\t1\\t779\\n364\\t1\\t779\\n381\\t1\\t779\\n382\\t2\\t779\\n385\\t1\\t779\\n458\\t2\\t779\\n481\\t1\\t779\\n483\\t2\\t779\\n484\\t1\\t779\\n485\\t1\\t779\\n495\\t1\\t779\\n591\\t2\\t779\\n598\\t1\\t779\\n639\\t1\\t779\\n779\\t8\\t779\\n780\\t1\\t779\\n790\\t1\\t779\\n822\\t1\\t779\\n981\\t1\\t779\\n982\\t1\\t779\\n1055\\t1\\t779\\n1083\\t1\\t779\\n1086\\t1\\t779\\n1295\\t1\\t779\\n1297\\t1\\t779\\n1358\\t1\\t779\\n1402\\t1\\t779\\n1403\\t1\\t779\\n1410\\t1\\t779\\n1417\\t1\\t779\\n1417\\t1\\t779\\n.I 780\\n.T\\nThe Measures of Information Retrieval Effectiveness proposed by Swets\\n.A\\nBrookes, B.

Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen years\\nold rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  The\\nnet increase per annum of \\'citeable articles\\' is not as large as might otherwise\\nbe expected.\\n  Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending to\\nhave its own literature and \\'internal\\' citation practices, are hiving off from\\nthe classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.\\n  Thirdly it seems that the \\'building blocks\\' of an article can on average\\nbe adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information)\\nby reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main\\ntheme, associated concepts and methods, and general background.\\n.X\\n33\\t2\\t784\\n36\\t1\\t784\\n39\\t1\\t784\\n41\\t1\\t784\\n48\\t1\\t784\\n76\\t1\\t784\\n89\\t4\\t784\\n97\\t1\\t784\\n102\\t1\\t784\\n111\\t1\\t784\\n112\\t1\\t784\\n113\\t1\\t784\\n163\\t1\\t784\\n183\\t2\\t784\\n184\\t2\\t784\\n193\\t2\\t784\\n198\\t1\\t784\\n199\\t1\\t784\\n201\\t1\\t784\\n203\\t1\\t784\\n204\\t1\\t784\\n210\\t1\\t784\\n225\\t1\\t784\\n233\\t1\\t784\\n269\\t1\\t784\\n373\\t1\\t784\\n545\\t1\\t784\\n552\\t2\\t784\\n587\\t1\\t784\\n605\\t1\\t784\\n613\\t1\\t784\\n614\\t1\\t784\\n632\\t1\\t784\\n638\\t1\\t784\\n735\\t3\\t784\\n747\\t1\\t784\\n750\\t1\\t784\\n753\\t1\\t784\\n766\\t2\\t784\\n767\\t1\\t784\\n775\\t1\\t784\\n782\\t1\\t784\\n784\\t5\\t784\\n788\\t1\\t784\\n789\\t1\\t784\\n793\\t1\\t784\\n800\\t1\\t784\\n808\\t1\\t784\\n828\\t1\\t784\\n905\\t1\\t784\\n953\\t1\\t784\\n977\\t1\\t784\\n983\\t1\\t784\\n1016\\t1\\t784\\n1023\\t1\\t784\\n1030\\t1\\t784\\n1055\\t2\\t784\\n1082\\t1\\t784\\n1087\\t1\\t784\\n1090\\t1\\t784\\n1135\\t1\\t784\\n1260\\t1\\t784\\n1273\\t1\\t784\\n1275\\t2\\t784\\n1276\\t1\\t784\\n1278\\t1\\t784\\n1280\\t1\\t784\\n1283\\t1\\t784\\n1285\\t2\\t784\\n1286\\t2\\t784\\n1287\\t2\\t784\\n1302\\t2\\t784\\n1335\\t2\\t784\\n1338\\t1\\t784\\n1341\\t2\\t784\\n1346\\t1\\t784\\n1347\\t1\\t784\\n1390\\t1\\t784\\n1397\\t2\\t784\\n1417\\t1\\t784\\n1428\\t1\\t784\\n1432\\t2\\t784\\n1444\\t1\\t784\\n1444\\t1\\t784\\n.I 785\\n.T\\nThe Parametric Description of Retrieval Tests\\nPart I: The Basic Parameters\\n.A\\nRobertson, S.E.\\n.W\\n   Some parameters and techniques in use for describing the results of tests \\non IR systems are analysed.. Several considerations outside the score of the \\nusual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters.. In particular, a\\nvariable which produces a \\'performance curve\\' of a system corresponds to an\\nextension of the 2x2 table.. Also, the statistical relationships between\\nparameters are all-important.. It is considered that precision is not such a\\nuseful measure of performance (in conjunction with recall) as fallout..

N.\\n.A\\nBower, C. A.\\n.W\\n   The paper presents the results of a survey of the use of social science \\nperiodicals carried out at the National Lending Library during a period of four \\nweeks in 1968..\\n   Three-quarters of the requests came from universities and industrial \\norganizations and over 90% of the requests were for English language \\npublications.. Over a fifth of the requests were for seventeen titles.. There\\nwere marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types of\\norganizations and although the overall \\'half-life\\' of the literature proved to\\nbe 3 1/2 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another..\\n   Concerning the sources of references, it was discovered that compared with\\nscientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use of\\nabstracting and indexing publications..\\n   Appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey, a list of\\ntitle requested six or more times, and a list of abstracting and indexing \\npublications cited five or more times as sources of references..\\n.X\\n2\\t1\\t788\\n10\\t1\\t788\\n24\\t1\\t788\\n33\\t1\\t788\\n36\\t1\\t788\\n41\\t1\\t788\\n62\\t1\\t788\\n65\\t1\\t788\\n66\\t1\\t788\\n71\\t1\\t788\\n72\\t1\\t788\\n73\\t1\\t788\\n74\\t1\\t788\\n75\\t2\\t788\\n76\\t2\\t788\\n77\\t1\\t788\\n78\\t1\\t788\\n79\\t1\\t788\\n81\\t1\\t788\\n82\\t1\\t788\\n83\\t1\\t788\\n86\\t1\\t788\\n89\\t1\\t788\\n97\\t1\\t788\\n102\\t1\\t788\\n110\\t1\\t788\\n111\\t2\\t788\\n112\\t1\\t788\\n132\\t1\\t788\\n137\\t2\\t788\\n139\\t1\\t788\\n147\\t1\\t788\\n152\\t1\\t788\\n153\\t1\\t788\\n155\\t2\\t788\\n156\\t1\\t788\\n163\\t1\\t788\\n183\\t2\\t788\\n184\\t1\\t788\\n193\\t1\\t788\\n195\\t1\\t788\\n199\\t1\\t788\\n203\\t2\\t788\\n204\\t1\\t788\\n210\\t5\\t788\\n211\\t1\\t788\\n212\\t1\\t788\\n225\\t1\\t788\\n245\\t1\\t788\\n269\\t1\\t788\\n277\\t1\\t788\\n278\\t1\\t788\\n279\\t2\\t788\\n280\\t2\\t788\\n355\\t1\\t788\\n359\\t1\\t788\\n373\\t1\\t788\\n386\\t1\\t788\\n395\\t1\\t788\\n398\\t1\\t788\\n475\\t2\\t788\\n486\\t1\\t788\\n545\\t2\\t788\\n552\\t2\\t788\\n587\\t1\\t788\\n605\\t1\\t788\\n613\\t1\\t788\\n614\\t1\\t788\\n638\\t1\\t788\\n658\\t2\\t788\\n716\\t1\\t788\\n720\\t1\\t788\\n735\\t1\\t788\\n747\\t1\\t788\\n748\\t2\\t788\\n750\\t1\\t788\\n753\\t1\\t788\\n760\\t2\\t788\\n763\\t1\\t788\\n766\\t1\\t788\\n767\\t1\\t788\\n771\\t1\\t788\\n774\\t1\\t788\\n775\\t2\\t788\\n782\\t2\\t788\\n784\\t1\\t788\\n785\\t1\\t788\\n786\\t1\\t788\\n787\\t2\\t788\\n788\\t18\\t788\\n789\\t7\\t788\\n791\\t1\\t788\\n793\\t1\\t788\\n800\\t1\\t788\\n808\\t1\\t788\\n837\\t1\\t788\\n840\\t1\\t788\\n905\\t1\\t788\\n925\\t2\\t788\\n953\\t1\\t788\\n977\\t2\\t788\\n983\\t1\\t788\\n984\\t1\\t788\\n986\\t1\\t788\\n1016\\t1\\t788\\n1023\\t1\\t788\\n1030\\t1\\t788\\n1050\\t1\\t788\\n1055\\t3\\t788\\n1056\\t1\\t788\\n1083\\t1\\t788\\n1085\\t1\\t788\\n1087\\t1\\t788\\n1090\\t1\\t788\\n1135\\t1\\t788\\n1254\\t2\\t788\\n1260\\t1\\t788\\n1275\\t2\\t788\\n1276\\t1\\t788\\n1278\\t1\\t788\\n1280\\t1\\t788\\n1285\\t1\\t788\\n1286\\t1\\t788\\n1287\\t1\\t788\\n1291\\t1\\t788\\n1302\\t1\\t788\\n1335\\t1\\t788\\n1361\\t1\\t788\\n1390\\t2\\t788\\n1397\\t1\\t788\\n1400\\t1\\t788\\n1404\\t2\\t788\\n1417\\t1\\t788\\n1428\\t1\\t788\\n1432\\t1\\t788\\n1451\\t2\\t788\\n1451\\t2\\t788\\n.I 789\\n.T\\nSocial Science Literature Use in the UK as Indicated by Citations\\n.A\\nEarle, Penelope\\n.A\\nVickery, Brian\\n.W\\n   A sample of citations made in 1965 United Kingdom social science literature\\nhas been analyzed according to subject, bibliographic form, country of origin,\\nlanguage, and date, and comparisons made with citations from science and \\ntechnology literature..

The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is,\\nthe product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.  This type of\\nbehaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from\\nmeteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanations\\nappropriate to the particular fields.

Numerous\\nstudies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish\\nobsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points out\\nthat different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the\\n\\'half-life\\' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of\\nliterature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accurate\\nmeasures for discriminating between different subject-fields.\\n.X\\n33\\t4\\t793\\n36\\t2\\t793\\n41\\t1\\t793\\n48\\t1\\t793\\n57\\t1\\t793\\n88\\t1\\t793\\n89\\t1\\t793\\n97\\t1\\t793\\n102\\t2\\t793\\n103\\t1\\t793\\n104\\t1\\t793\\n106\\t3\\t793\\n110\\t1\\t793\\n111\\t4\\t793\\n112\\t3\\t793\\n113\\t2\\t793\\n155\\t1\\t793\\n163\\t1\\t793\\n170\\t1\\t793\\n183\\t1\\t793\\n184\\t2\\t793\\n193\\t2\\t793\\n195\\t1\\t793\\n199\\t1\\t793\\n201\\t1\\t793\\n203\\t2\\t793\\n204\\t1\\t793\\n205\\t1\\t793\\n210\\t1\\t793\\n225\\t1\\t793\\n233\\t1\\t793\\n267\\t2\\t793\\n269\\t1\\t793\\n314\\t1\\t793\\n359\\t1\\t793\\n373\\t1\\t793\\n395\\t1\\t793\\n456\\t2\\t793\\n545\\t2\\t793\\n552\\t1\\t793\\n560\\t1\\t793\\n587\\t7\\t793\\n588\\t1\\t793\\n605\\t1\\t793\\n613\\t1\\t793\\n614\\t4\\t793\\n638\\t2\\t793\\n651\\t1\\t793\\n667\\t1\\t793\\n735\\t1\\t793\\n747\\t2\\t793\\n748\\t2\\t793\\n750\\t4\\t793\\n751\\t2\\t793\\n753\\t1\\t793\\n759\\t1\\t793\\n765\\t2\\t793\\n766\\t1\\t793\\n767\\t3\\t793\\n775\\t3\\t793\\n778\\t2\\t793\\n782\\t1\\t793\\n784\\t1\\t793\\n786\\t1\\t793\\n787\\t1\\t793\\n788\\t1\\t793\\n789\\t1\\t793\\n791\\t2\\t793\\n792\\t2\\t793\\n793\\t16\\t793\\n794\\t5\\t793\\n800\\t9\\t793\\n808\\t4\\t793\\n811\\t1\\t793\\n905\\t1\\t793\\n925\\t1\\t793\\n948\\t1\\t793\\n953\\t1\\t793\\n977\\t1\\t793\\n983\\t2\\t793\\n1010\\t1\\t793\\n1016\\t1\\t793\\n1019\\t1\\t793\\n1023\\t1\\t793\\n1030\\t1\\t793\\n1055\\t1\\t793\\n1062\\t1\\t793\\n1081\\t1\\t793\\n1082\\t1\\t793\\n1083\\t1\\t793\\n1085\\t1\\t793\\n1086\\t2\\t793\\n1087\\t2\\t793\\n1090\\t3\\t793\\n1135\\t1\\t793\\n1201\\t1\\t793\\n1222\\t1\\t793\\n1260\\t1\\t793\\n1275\\t1\\t793\\n1276\\t1\\t793\\n1278\\t2\\t793\\n1280\\t1\\t793\\n1285\\t5\\t793\\n1286\\t1\\t793\\n1287\\t3\\t793\\n1291\\t1\\t793\\n1302\\t1\\t793\\n1308\\t1\\t793\\n1335\\t2\\t793\\n1340\\t1\\t793\\n1344\\t1\\t793\\n1346\\t1\\t793\\n1347\\t1\\t793\\n1390\\t1\\t793\\n1397\\t1\\t793\\n1401\\t1\\t793\\n1417\\t2\\t793\\n1418\\t1\\t793\\n1428\\t1\\t793\\n1432\\t1\\t793\\n1432\\t1\\t793\\n.I 794\\n.T\\n\\'Half-Life\\'\\n.A\\nVickery, B.C.\\n.B\\nV. 26\\n1970\\n.W\\n  The first diagram below gives a schematic view of a subject literature that\\nis growing exponentially with time - the number of items published per\\nyear doubles in five years.

This was a\\nsubject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length,\\nadvancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits,\\nwithout ever stating a single demonstratable fact.  When, in the early 1950\\'s,\\nvarious people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for\\nindexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it\\nappeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments.  In an\\neditorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint,\\nshared by many others, when he wrote: \\n\\n    Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is\\n    essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems.  May\\n    the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts\\n    of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems\\n    of the future.  There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if\\n    we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the\\n    benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the\\n    intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and\\n    costs.  The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we\\n    are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid\\n    intellectual discipline.\\n.X\\n38\\t1\\t795\\n72\\t2\\t795\\n84\\t1\\t795\\n120\\t1\\t795\\n149\\t1\\t795\\n160\\t1\\t795\\n197\\t1\\t795\\n382\\t2\\t795\\n486\\t1\\t795\\n488\\t1\\t795\\n489\\t1\\t795\\n490\\t1\\t795\\n491\\t1\\t795\\n492\\t1\\t795\\n493\\t1\\t795\\n494\\t1\\t795\\n495\\t1\\t795\\n496\\t1\\t795\\n497\\t1\\t795\\n499\\t1\\t795\\n500\\t1\\t795\\n506\\t1\\t795\\n558\\t1\\t795\\n565\\t1\\t795\\n572\\t1\\t795\\n581\\t1\\t795\\n583\\t1\\t795\\n584\\t1\\t795\\n586\\t1\\t795\\n625\\t1\\t795\\n628\\t1\\t795\\n633\\t1\\t795\\n634\\t1\\t795\\n643\\t1\\t795\\n659\\t2\\t795\\n696\\t1\\t795\\n705\\t1\\t795\\n736\\t1\\t795\\n752\\t1\\t795\\n781\\t1\\t795\\n789\\t1\\t795\\n795\\t8\\t795\\n796\\t1\\t795\\n798\\t1\\t795\\n801\\t1\\t795\\n814\\t1\\t795\\n824\\t1\\t795\\n826\\t1\\t795\\n901\\t1\\t795\\n902\\t1\\t795\\n906\\t1\\t795\\n907\\t1\\t795\\n986\\t1\\t795\\n1089\\t1\\t795\\n1202\\t1\\t795\\n1209\\t1\\t795\\n1218\\t1\\t795\\n1250\\t1\\t795\\n1255\\t1\\t795\\n1289\\t1\\t795\\n1294\\t2\\t795\\n1414\\t1\\t795\\n1422\\t1\\t795\\n1422\\t1\\t795\\n.I 796\\n.T\\nSwitching Languages for Indexing\\n.A\\nCoates, E.

This\\nimplies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole\\noperation is often referred to neatly as \\'locating and relating\\'.  Assuming\\nthat we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be\\nrelevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of\\nparticular classes and their relations.  The fact that the instrument we use to\\nassist this operation may display quasi-classificatory features (e.g.,\\nalphabetical sequence) or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory\\nstore should not hide this otherwise obvious fact.\\n.X\\n117\\t1\\t797\\n159\\t2\\t797\\n165\\t1\\t797\\n257\\t2\\t797\\n260\\t1\\t797\\n348\\t1\\t797\\n429\\t1\\t797\\n445\\t1\\t797\\n476\\t1\\t797\\n489\\t1\\t797\\n493\\t1\\t797\\n498\\t1\\t797\\n501\\t1\\t797\\n525\\t1\\t797\\n582\\t1\\t797\\n583\\t2\\t797\\n585\\t1\\t797\\n590\\t1\\t797\\n621\\t1\\t797\\n653\\t1\\t797\\n655\\t2\\t797\\n668\\t1\\t797\\n670\\t1\\t797\\n671\\t1\\t797\\n674\\t1\\t797\\n683\\t1\\t797\\n688\\t1\\t797\\n689\\t1\\t797\\n715\\t2\\t797\\n796\\t1\\t797\\n797\\t5\\t797\\n798\\t3\\t797\\n799\\t1\\t797\\n801\\t2\\t797\\n802\\t1\\t797\\n819\\t1\\t797\\n858\\t1\\t797\\n859\\t1\\t797\\n861\\t1\\t797\\n989\\t1\\t797\\n1077\\t1\\t797\\n1230\\t1\\t797\\n1231\\t1\\t797\\n1265\\t1\\t797\\n1393\\t1\\t797\\n1394\\t1\\t797\\n1405\\t1\\t797\\n1405\\t1\\t797\\n.I 798\\n.T\\nThe Thesaurofacet: A Multipurpose Retrieval Language Tool\\n.A\\nAitchison, Jean\\n.W\\n   A description is given of the English Electric \\'Thesaurofacet\\', a faceted \\nclassification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific, \\ntechnical, and management subjects.. A novel feature of the system is the \\nintegration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appears\\nboth in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term is\\ndisplayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements \\nthis information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships \\nwhich cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word \\nforms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers.. \\nThe resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement \\nand conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and\\ncomputerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain\\ntraditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines\\nfor main classes, the lack of a \\'built-in\\' preferred order, and the use, in \\ncertain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term\\nconcepts..

H.\\n.W\\n   The feasibility is examined of devising a scheme for operating a joint \\nkeyword system in a given subject area using several independently compiled \\nthesauri.. It is suggested that if the individual keywords of each \\nparticipating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts, and these concepts are\\ngiven unique code numbers, then the code numbers enable the keywords of any\\nparticipating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any\\nother participant.. Incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from \\ndifferences in the selection and form of keywords.. Eleven types of \\nincompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for \\neach.. The types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include \\nthose that arise between one language and another, so that a multilingual joint \\nsystem presents no additional problems..\\n.X\\n16\\t1\\t802\\n114\\t1\\t802\\n148\\t1\\t802\\n151\\t1\\t802\\n154\\t2\\t802\\n159\\t1\\t802\\n194\\t1\\t802\\n212\\t1\\t802\\n257\\t1\\t802\\n333\\t1\\t802\\n346\\t1\\t802\\n429\\t1\\t802\\n449\\t1\\t802\\n454\\t1\\t802\\n458\\t1\\t802\\n477\\t1\\t802\\n489\\t1\\t802\\n493\\t1\\t802\\n498\\t1\\t802\\n501\\t2\\t802\\n504\\t1\\t802\\n530\\t1\\t802\\n553\\t1\\t802\\n582\\t1\\t802\\n583\\t1\\t802\\n627\\t1\\t802\\n628\\t1\\t802\\n653\\t2\\t802\\n655\\t1\\t802\\n688\\t1\\t802\\n770\\t1\\t802\\n781\\t1\\t802\\n796\\t4\\t802\\n797\\t1\\t802\\n798\\t1\\t802\\n801\\t1\\t802\\n802\\t7\\t802\\n819\\t1\\t802\\n838\\t1\\t802\\n874\\t1\\t802\\n877\\t1\\t802\\n878\\t1\\t802\\n940\\t1\\t802\\n941\\t1\\t802\\n989\\t1\\t802\\n992\\t1\\t802\\n993\\t1\\t802\\n995\\t1\\t802\\n1079\\t1\\t802\\n1216\\t1\\t802\\n1392\\t1\\t802\\n1405\\t1\\t802\\n1421\\t1\\t802\\n1431\\t2\\t802\\n1434\\t1\\t802\\n1435\\t1\\t802\\n1436\\t1\\t802\\n1448\\t1\\t802\\n1448\\t1\\t802\\n.I 803\\n.T\\nProgress in Documentation\\n.A\\nFoskett, D.J.\\n.W\\n  The term \\'informatics\\' was first advanced formally by the Director\\nof Viniti, A.I.

A suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the\\nRecall ratio - the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the\\nsystem.. When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not \\npracticable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A\\nnumber of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory.. Another\\nmeasure of retrieval performance is the Extension ratio which is approximately\\nthe ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting \\na query to the retrieval system.. The properties of this measure are examined \\nand it is applied to 315 MEDLARS searches..\\n.X\\n75\\t1\\t806\\n161\\t1\\t806\\n197\\t1\\t806\\n375\\t1\\t806\\n445\\t1\\t806\\n447\\t1\\t806\\n454\\t1\\t806\\n472\\t1\\t806\\n503\\t1\\t806\\n506\\t1\\t806\\n507\\t1\\t806\\n514\\t1\\t806\\n526\\t1\\t806\\n554\\t1\\t806\\n579\\t1\\t806\\n591\\t1\\t806\\n593\\t1\\t806\\n594\\t1\\t806\\n595\\t1\\t806\\n596\\t1\\t806\\n597\\t1\\t806\\n599\\t1\\t806\\n600\\t1\\t806\\n603\\t1\\t806\\n604\\t1\\t806\\n606\\t1\\t806\\n623\\t1\\t806\\n639\\t1\\t806\\n660\\t1\\t806\\n696\\t1\\t806\\n723\\t1\\t806\\n724\\t1\\t806\\n752\\t1\\t806\\n801\\t1\\t806\\n805\\t1\\t806\\n806\\t5\\t806\\n836\\t1\\t806\\n866\\t1\\t806\\n867\\t1\\t806\\n956\\t1\\t806\\n989\\t1\\t806\\n1298\\t1\\t806\\n1299\\t1\\t806\\n1327\\t1\\t806\\n1405\\t1\\t806\\n1405\\t1\\t806\\n.I 807\\n.T\\nFree Text Word Retrieval and Scientist Indexing:\\nPerformance Profile and Costs\\n.A\\nHersey, D.

This divides the file into retrieved\\nand not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference score\\ncalculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring \\nreferences in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages in\\ntheory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to\\nthe number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In the\\ntest a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number of\\nreferences matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique\\nsuccessfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many \\nrelevant references as the Boolean searches..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t810\\n34\\t1\\t810\\n49\\t1\\t810\\n51\\t1\\t810\\n53\\t1\\t810\\n54\\t2\\t810\\n57\\t1\\t810\\n59\\t1\\t810\\n69\\t1\\t810\\n71\\t1\\t810\\n73\\t1\\t810\\n75\\t1\\t810\\n77\\t2\\t810\\n79\\t2\\t810\\n150\\t1\\t810\\n164\\t1\\t810\\n168\\t1\\t810\\n175\\t3\\t810\\n176\\t2\\t810\\n202\\t1\\t810\\n213\\t1\\t810\\n224\\t1\\t810\\n243\\t1\\t810\\n315\\t1\\t810\\n319\\t2\\t810\\n329\\t1\\t810\\n382\\t1\\t810\\n421\\t1\\t810\\n448\\t2\\t810\\n465\\t1\\t810\\n466\\t2\\t810\\n471\\t1\\t810\\n480\\t1\\t810\\n483\\t1\\t810\\n484\\t1\\t810\\n486\\t1\\t810\\n488\\t1\\t810\\n490\\t1\\t810\\n491\\t2\\t810\\n493\\t1\\t810\\n503\\t1\\t810\\n506\\t1\\t810\\n507\\t2\\t810\\n509\\t2\\t810\\n510\\t2\\t810\\n512\\t2\\t810\\n517\\t1\\t810\\n518\\t1\\t810\\n519\\t1\\t810\\n520\\t1\\t810\\n522\\t1\\t810\\n527\\t1\\t810\\n528\\t1\\t810\\n531\\t3\\t810\\n565\\t4\\t810\\n566\\t1\\t810\\n572\\t1\\t810\\n581\\t1\\t810\\n591\\t1\\t810\\n595\\t2\\t810\\n596\\t2\\t810\\n603\\t2\\t810\\n604\\t1\\t810\\n608\\t2\\t810\\n619\\t1\\t810\\n622\\t1\\t810\\n623\\t1\\t810\\n625\\t2\\t810\\n629\\t1\\t810\\n633\\t2\\t810\\n634\\t1\\t810\\n639\\t1\\t810\\n659\\t3\\t810\\n660\\t3\\t810\\n676\\t1\\t810\\n711\\t1\\t810\\n714\\t1\\t810\\n715\\t1\\t810\\n722\\t1\\t810\\n723\\t1\\t810\\n726\\t1\\t810\\n728\\t1\\t810\\n730\\t1\\t810\\n731\\t1\\t810\\n732\\t1\\t810\\n754\\t1\\t810\\n780\\t1\\t810\\n785\\t1\\t810\\n790\\t1\\t810\\n805\\t1\\t810\\n809\\t2\\t810\\n810\\t10\\t810\\n812\\t5\\t810\\n813\\t3\\t810\\n814\\t5\\t810\\n817\\t2\\t810\\n820\\t1\\t810\\n822\\t1\\t810\\n824\\t1\\t810\\n825\\t1\\t810\\n828\\t1\\t810\\n870\\t2\\t810\\n879\\t1\\t810\\n894\\t4\\t810\\n928\\t1\\t810\\n960\\t1\\t810\\n963\\t1\\t810\\n990\\t1\\t810\\n991\\t1\\t810\\n1051\\t1\\t810\\n1091\\t1\\t810\\n1219\\t1\\t810\\n1255\\t1\\t810\\n1283\\t1\\t810\\n1294\\t2\\t810\\n1298\\t1\\t810\\n1299\\t1\\t810\\n1307\\t1\\t810\\n1327\\t2\\t810\\n1363\\t1\\t810\\n1366\\t1\\t810\\n1367\\t1\\t810\\n1368\\t1\\t810\\n1396\\t1\\t810\\n1413\\t1\\t810\\n1419\\t1\\t810\\n1427\\t2\\t810\\n1445\\t1\\t810\\n1445\\t1\\t810\\n.I 811\\n.T\\nMeasuring Readers\\' Failure at the Shelf\\n.A\\nUrquhart, John A.\\n.A\\nSchofield, J. L.\\n.W\\n   This paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by \\nthe Library.. It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the \\nnon-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has already\\nbeen installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one \\nlibrary are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out\\nthe degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library,\\nthe causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand\\nand not available..\\n   They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, \\nthe number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of \\ndemand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for \\nbooks that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of \\ntime, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure \\nfrom one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the \\nlibrary..\\n   From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library \\nprocedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of books\\nfailing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library.. The \\ntime spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given..\\n.X\\n4\\t2\\t811\\n5\\t2\\t811\\n9\\t2\\t811\\n32\\t1\\t811\\n33\\t1\\t811\\n96\\t1\\t811\\n115\\t1\\t811\\n137\\t1\\t811\\n163\\t1\\t811\\n207\\t7\\t811\\n217\\t1\\t811\\n222\\t1\\t811\\n223\\t1\\t811\\n234\\t3\\t811\\n245\\t2\\t811\\n267\\t1\\t811\\n296\\t1\\t811\\n297\\t1\\t811\\n298\\t1\\t811\\n300\\t1\\t811\\n301\\t1\\t811\\n302\\t1\\t811\\n358\\t1\\t811\\n364\\t3\\t811\\n365\\t1\\t811\\n456\\t1\\t811\\n502\\t3\\t811\\n515\\t1\\t811\\n535\\t1\\t811\\n614\\t1\\t811\\n625\\t1\\t811\\n629\\t1\\t811\\n631\\t1\\t811\\n634\\t1\\t811\\n638\\t2\\t811\\n651\\t1\\t811\\n748\\t1\\t811\\n751\\t1\\t811\\n764\\t2\\t811\\n765\\t1\\t811\\n766\\t1\\t811\\n768\\t1\\t811\\n774\\t1\\t811\\n778\\t1\\t811\\n783\\t2\\t811\\n786\\t1\\t811\\n791\\t2\\t811\\n793\\t1\\t811\\n799\\t1\\t811\\n800\\t1\\t811\\n811\\t14\\t811\\n816\\t7\\t811\\n818\\t2\\t811\\n823\\t2\\t811\\n842\\t2\\t811\\n843\\t1\\t811\\n844\\t1\\t811\\n846\\t1\\t811\\n913\\t1\\t811\\n915\\t1\\t811\\n925\\t4\\t811\\n944\\t1\\t811\\n948\\t3\\t811\\n959\\t1\\t811\\n960\\t1\\t811\\n961\\t3\\t811\\n962\\t3\\t811\\n963\\t3\\t811\\n964\\t3\\t811\\n968\\t1\\t811\\n983\\t1\\t811\\n994\\t3\\t811\\n1015\\t1\\t811\\n1019\\t1\\t811\\n1023\\t1\\t811\\n1068\\t1\\t811\\n1203\\t1\\t811\\n1242\\t1\\t811\\n1247\\t1\\t811\\n1257\\t1\\t811\\n1268\\t1\\t811\\n1321\\t1\\t811\\n1354\\t1\\t811\\n1400\\t1\\t811\\n1407\\t1\\t811\\n1445\\t1\\t811\\n1445\\t1\\t811\\n.I 812\\n.T\\nA Statistical Interpretation of Term Specificity \\nand Its Application in Retrieval\\n.A\\nSparck-Jones, K.\\n.W\\n   The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms\\nare usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be\\ninterpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term \\nmeaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are \\nexamined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that\\nfrequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is\\nargued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that \\nmatches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches\\non frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable \\nimprovements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t812\\n26\\t1\\t812\\n51\\t2\\t812\\n57\\t3\\t812\\n69\\t1\\t812\\n71\\t1\\t812\\n73\\t2\\t812\\n75\\t2\\t812\\n77\\t1\\t812\\n79\\t2\\t812\\n124\\t1\\t812\\n125\\t2\\t812\\n145\\t1\\t812\\n165\\t1\\t812\\n168\\t1\\t812\\n175\\t1\\t812\\n176\\t3\\t812\\n211\\t1\\t812\\n274\\t1\\t812\\n315\\t2\\t812\\n329\\t1\\t812\\n378\\t1\\t812\\n381\\t1\\t812\\n382\\t1\\t812\\n389\\t1\\t812\\n390\\t1\\t812\\n419\\t3\\t812\\n440\\t1\\t812\\n441\\t1\\t812\\n445\\t1\\t812\\n448\\t2\\t812\\n449\\t1\\t812\\n452\\t2\\t812\\n453\\t1\\t812\\n466\\t1\\t812\\n467\\t1\\t812\\n468\\t1\\t812\\n480\\t1\\t812\\n483\\t1\\t812\\n484\\t2\\t812\\n486\\t1\\t812\\n488\\t1\\t812\\n491\\t1\\t812\\n493\\t1\\t812\\n495\\t1\\t812\\n503\\t1\\t812\\n506\\t1\\t812\\n507\\t1\\t812\\n508\\t1\\t812\\n509\\t2\\t812\\n510\\t1\\t812\\n511\\t2\\t812\\n512\\t2\\t812\\n514\\t1\\t812\\n516\\t1\\t812\\n517\\t2\\t812\\n518\\t2\\t812\\n520\\t2\\t812\\n521\\t2\\t812\\n522\\t2\\t812\\n523\\t2\\t812\\n524\\t1\\t812\\n526\\t2\\t812\\n527\\t2\\t812\\n528\\t3\\t812\\n529\\t1\\t812\\n531\\t5\\t812\\n565\\t4\\t812\\n566\\t2\\t812\\n572\\t1\\t812\\n575\\t2\\t812\\n576\\t1\\t812\\n577\\t3\\t812\\n580\\t1\\t812\\n581\\t1\\t812\\n595\\t1\\t812\\n596\\t2\\t812\\n603\\t1\\t812\\n604\\t1\\t812\\n608\\t2\\t812\\n609\\t1\\t812\\n610\\t1\\t812\\n612\\t1\\t812\\n615\\t1\\t812\\n619\\t2\\t812\\n622\\t1\\t812\\n623\\t1\\t812\\n625\\t3\\t812\\n626\\t1\\t812\\n629\\t1\\t812\\n631\\t1\\t812\\n632\\t1\\t812\\n633\\t2\\t812\\n634\\t2\\t812\\n636\\t1\\t812\\n643\\t1\\t812\\n644\\t2\\t812\\n649\\t2\\t812\\n652\\t1\\t812\\n659\\t2\\t812\\n660\\t3\\t812\\n662\\t1\\t812\\n699\\t1\\t812\\n700\\t2\\t812\\n705\\t2\\t812\\n707\\t2\\t812\\n715\\t1\\t812\\n723\\t1\\t812\\n726\\t1\\t812\\n727\\t2\\t812\\n728\\t1\\t812\\n729\\t1\\t812\\n730\\t1\\t812\\n731\\t1\\t812\\n752\\t3\\t812\\n754\\t4\\t812\\n780\\t3\\t812\\n785\\t1\\t812\\n790\\t1\\t812\\n805\\t1\\t812\\n809\\t1\\t812\\n810\\t5\\t812\\n812\\t15\\t812\\n813\\t3\\t812\\n814\\t5\\t812\\n817\\t3\\t812\\n820\\t1\\t812\\n822\\t1\\t812\\n824\\t5\\t812\\n825\\t1\\t812\\n829\\t1\\t812\\n830\\t1\\t812\\n866\\t1\\t812\\n870\\t2\\t812\\n873\\t1\\t812\\n875\\t1\\t812\\n894\\t3\\t812\\n895\\t1\\t812\\n928\\t1\\t812\\n956\\t1\\t812\\n963\\t1\\t812\\n990\\t1\\t812\\n991\\t1\\t812\\n1051\\t1\\t812\\n1078\\t1\\t812\\n1089\\t1\\t812\\n1091\\t1\\t812\\n1143\\t1\\t812\\n1255\\t1\\t812\\n1264\\t1\\t812\\n1282\\t2\\t812\\n1294\\t2\\t812\\n1302\\t1\\t812\\n1303\\t2\\t812\\n1307\\t1\\t812\\n1327\\t4\\t812\\n1364\\t1\\t812\\n1366\\t2\\t812\\n1367\\t2\\t812\\n1368\\t2\\t812\\n1396\\t1\\t812\\n1413\\t1\\t812\\n1419\\t1\\t812\\n1427\\t1\\t812\\n1445\\t1\\t812\\n1445\\t1\\t812\\n.I 813\\n.T\\nComparative Efficiency of Searching Titles, Abstracts, and Terms \\nin a Free-Text Data Base\\n.A\\nBarcer, F.

L.\\n.W\\n   This paper continues the reporting of the Unit\\'s work on a method of \\ninvestigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the \\nshelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find..\\n   The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were\\nasked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they\\nwere looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status,\\nand the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of\\nthese \\'failure\\' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader\\'s\\nfailure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of\\nfailure for different groups of volumes..\\n  A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the\\nfortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the\\neffect or failure on a reader\\'s work, what action he took after failing, whether\\nhe found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what\\nproportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be\\nchecked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library..\\n   The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with \\nits own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns..

In fact, the definition of objectives in any\\nservice organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the\\nexplicit commitment to users\\' needs (however mystical this concept may\\nbe) requires the librarian to examine users\\' behaviour as a first step\\nto determining policy.

For the purpose of this \\npresentation, however, I shall concentrate on the handling of  scientific \\ndocuments in the first, narrower sense, and only refer to other categories of \\ntexts in so far as they have been submitted to analytical processes of a \\ncomparable nature..\\n.X\\n117\\t1\\t819\\n146\\t1\\t819\\n165\\t1\\t819\\n168\\t1\\t819\\n333\\t1\\t819\\n445\\t1\\t819\\n449\\t1\\t819\\n476\\t1\\t819\\n498\\t1\\t819\\n525\\t1\\t819\\n530\\t1\\t819\\n553\\t1\\t819\\n572\\t1\\t819\\n574\\t1\\t819\\n590\\t1\\t819\\n621\\t1\\t819\\n628\\t1\\t819\\n668\\t1\\t819\\n670\\t1\\t819\\n671\\t1\\t819\\n674\\t1\\t819\\n683\\t1\\t819\\n689\\t1\\t819\\n715\\t1\\t819\\n790\\t1\\t819\\n797\\t1\\t819\\n802\\t1\\t819\\n819\\t5\\t819\\n830\\t1\\t819\\n874\\t1\\t819\\n877\\t1\\t819\\n878\\t1\\t819\\n940\\t1\\t819\\n941\\t1\\t819\\n992\\t1\\t819\\n993\\t1\\t819\\n995\\t1\\t819\\n1024\\t1\\t819\\n1027\\t1\\t819\\n1077\\t1\\t819\\n1079\\t1\\t819\\n1215\\t1\\t819\\n1216\\t1\\t819\\n1231\\t2\\t819\\n1421\\t1\\t819\\n1434\\t1\\t819\\n1435\\t1\\t819\\n1436\\t1\\t819\\n1443\\t1\\t819\\n1443\\t1\\t819\\n.I 820\\n.T\\nStudies to Compare Retrieval Using Titles with that Using Index Terms.\\nSDI from \\'Nuclear Science Abstracts\\'\\n.A\\nOlive, G.\\n.A\\nTerry, J.

N.\\n.W\\n   The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the\\nstudy of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and \\nlarge increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and \\nbiophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The\\nconsequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great \\ndifficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To \\ncope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals\\nin this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review \\nof biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the \\nimpact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately \\nthan the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the \\npredominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort \\ntoday, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical\\nmethodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to \\nsize of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been\\ndeveloped and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which \\nshould be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in \\nrelation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information \\ncontent, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of \\npresentation..\\n   The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to \\nBradford\\'s Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, \\nnamely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a \\nscientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in \\nincreasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that \\nthe present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers \\nin the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their \\nsignificance to the active areas or present day biochemical research..\\n.X\\n48\\t1\\t821\\n167\\t1\\t821\\n189\\t1\\t821\\n193\\t1\\t821\\n195\\t1\\t821\\n196\\t1\\t821\\n198\\t1\\t821\\n201\\t2\\t821\\n219\\t1\\t821\\n379\\t1\\t821\\n588\\t1\\t821\\n614\\t2\\t821\\n616\\t1\\t821\\n635\\t1\\t821\\n638\\t2\\t821\\n685\\t1\\t821\\n735\\t1\\t821\\n748\\t1\\t821\\n753\\t1\\t821\\n756\\t1\\t821\\n757\\t1\\t821\\n775\\t1\\t821\\n787\\t1\\t821\\n792\\t1\\t821\\n821\\t5\\t821\\n831\\t1\\t821\\n905\\t1\\t821\\n952\\t1\\t821\\n953\\t1\\t821\\n1083\\t1\\t821\\n1210\\t1\\t821\\n1254\\t1\\t821\\n1256\\t1\\t821\\n1260\\t1\\t821\\n1275\\t3\\t821\\n1278\\t1\\t821\\n1290\\t1\\t821\\n1302\\t3\\t821\\n1352\\t1\\t821\\n1355\\t2\\t821\\n1369\\t2\\t821\\n1373\\t1\\t821\\n1397\\t1\\t821\\n1418\\t1\\t821\\n1418\\t1\\t821\\n.I 822\\n.T\\nA Cost Survey of Mechanized Information Systems\\n.A\\nVickers, P.

The system is firmly based upon the concept of an\\nopen-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the\\nindex at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature.\\nOnce a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are\\nhandled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the\\nsemantic sides of the system.\\n.X\\n10\\t1\\t825\\n51\\t1\\t825\\n69\\t1\\t825\\n71\\t1\\t825\\n77\\t1\\t825\\n79\\t2\\t825\\n86\\t1\\t825\\n92\\t1\\t825\\n146\\t1\\t825\\n160\\t1\\t825\\n168\\t2\\t825\\n172\\t1\\t825\\n175\\t1\\t825\\n176\\t1\\t825\\n190\\t1\\t825\\n194\\t1\\t825\\n225\\t1\\t825\\n244\\t1\\t825\\n246\\t1\\t825\\n258\\t1\\t825\\n304\\t1\\t825\\n305\\t1\\t825\\n306\\t1\\t825\\n315\\t1\\t825\\n358\\t1\\t825\\n361\\t1\\t825\\n365\\t1\\t825\\n382\\t2\\t825\\n385\\t1\\t825\\n394\\t1\\t825\\n422\\t1\\t825\\n433\\t1\\t825\\n448\\t1\\t825\\n453\\t1\\t825\\n458\\t1\\t825\\n459\\t1\\t825\\n478\\t1\\t825\\n480\\t2\\t825\\n483\\t1\\t825\\n484\\t1\\t825\\n486\\t1\\t825\\n487\\t1\\t825\\n488\\t1\\t825\\n491\\t1\\t825\\n493\\t1\\t825\\n503\\t1\\t825\\n507\\t1\\t825\\n509\\t1\\t825\\n510\\t1\\t825\\n512\\t1\\t825\\n517\\t1\\t825\\n520\\t1\\t825\\n522\\t1\\t825\\n527\\t1\\t825\\n528\\t1\\t825\\n530\\t1\\t825\\n531\\t1\\t825\\n534\\t1\\t825\\n565\\t1\\t825\\n566\\t1\\t825\\n577\\t1\\t825\\n581\\t1\\t825\\n596\\t1\\t825\\n603\\t1\\t825\\n608\\t2\\t825\\n633\\t1\\t825\\n641\\t1\\t825\\n643\\t1\\t825\\n644\\t1\\t825\\n645\\t1\\t825\\n649\\t1\\t825\\n650\\t1\\t825\\n652\\t1\\t825\\n659\\t1\\t825\\n702\\t1\\t825\\n709\\t1\\t825\\n715\\t1\\t825\\n731\\t1\\t825\\n732\\t1\\t825\\n746\\t1\\t825\\n754\\t1\\t825\\n755\\t1\\t825\\n781\\t1\\t825\\n790\\t1\\t825\\n805\\t1\\t825\\n809\\t1\\t825\\n810\\t1\\t825\\n812\\t1\\t825\\n813\\t1\\t825\\n814\\t1\\t825\\n817\\t4\\t825\\n820\\t1\\t825\\n823\\t1\\t825\\n824\\t2\\t825\\n825\\t19\\t825\\n826\\t1\\t825\\n827\\t1\\t825\\n828\\t1\\t825\\n830\\t1\\t825\\n856\\t1\\t825\\n880\\t1\\t825\\n883\\t1\\t825\\n886\\t1\\t825\\n888\\t1\\t825\\n894\\t1\\t825\\n901\\t1\\t825\\n913\\t1\\t825\\n930\\t1\\t825\\n941\\t1\\t825\\n943\\t1\\t825\\n947\\t1\\t825\\n948\\t1\\t825\\n950\\t1\\t825\\n963\\t1\\t825\\n966\\t1\\t825\\n978\\t1\\t825\\n988\\t1\\t825\\n997\\t2\\t825\\n1004\\t1\\t825\\n1017\\t1\\t825\\n1024\\t2\\t825\\n1051\\t1\\t825\\n1054\\t1\\t825\\n1058\\t1\\t825\\n1061\\t1\\t825\\n1079\\t1\\t825\\n1146\\t2\\t825\\n1215\\t7\\t825\\n1216\\t2\\t825\\n1230\\t3\\t825\\n1257\\t2\\t825\\n1258\\t1\\t825\\n1266\\t1\\t825\\n1294\\t1\\t825\\n1327\\t1\\t825\\n1390\\t1\\t825\\n1394\\t1\\t825\\n1395\\t1\\t825\\n1419\\t1\\t825\\n1421\\t1\\t825\\n1427\\t1\\t825\\n1433\\t1\\t825\\n1441\\t2\\t825\\n1441\\t2\\t825\\n.I 826\\n.T\\nUser Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems\\n.A\\nCleverdon, C.W.\\n.W\\n  While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it,\\ncertainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit the\\nfundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clash\\nbetween OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only).\\nAlthough it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne\\'s\\nwritings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD\\nDocumentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meet\\nthese two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems,\\nand the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis\\nthat a \\'Marshalling\\' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from\\na \\'Retrieval\\' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this form\\nfor some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall\\nand precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the\\nrelevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But-\\nNot-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.\\n.X\\n10\\t1\\t826\\n18\\t1\\t826\\n61\\t1\\t826\\n120\\t1\\t826\\n124\\t1\\t826\\n127\\t2\\t826\\n129\\t1\\t826\\n145\\t1\\t826\\n190\\t3\\t826\\n191\\t1\\t826\\n197\\t2\\t826\\n211\\t1\\t826\\n214\\t1\\t826\\n218\\t1\\t826\\n225\\t1\\t826\\n243\\t1\\t826\\n244\\t1\\t826\\n274\\t1\\t826\\n304\\t1\\t826\\n305\\t1\\t826\\n306\\t1\\t826\\n307\\t1\\t826\\n320\\t1\\t826\\n330\\t1\\t826\\n332\\t1\\t826\\n357\\t1\\t826\\n358\\t1\\t826\\n376\\t1\\t826\\n378\\t1\\t826\\n382\\t1\\t826\\n385\\t1\\t826\\n394\\t1\\t826\\n433\\t1\\t826\\n450\\t1\\t826\\n451\\t1\\t826\\n452\\t1\\t826\\n458\\t1\\t826\\n459\\t7\\t826\\n468\\t1\\t826\\n484\\t2\\t826\\n492\\t1\\t826\\n506\\t1\\t826\\n508\\t2\\t826\\n511\\t1\\t826\\n512\\t1\\t826\\n514\\t1\\t826\\n518\\t1\\t826\\n520\\t1\\t826\\n523\\t2\\t826\\n524\\t2\\t826\\n525\\t2\\t826\\n526\\t3\\t826\\n527\\t1\\t826\\n528\\t1\\t826\\n529\\t2\\t826\\n530\\t2\\t826\\n532\\t1\\t826\\n534\\t4\\t826\\n546\\t3\\t826\\n553\\t1\\t826\\n579\\t3\\t826\\n594\\t2\\t826\\n603\\t1\\t826\\n604\\t1\\t826\\n606\\t3\\t826\\n609\\t1\\t826\\n610\\t1\\t826\\n611\\t1\\t826\\n612\\t1\\t826\\n625\\t3\\t826\\n626\\t3\\t826\\n630\\t1\\t826\\n633\\t1\\t826\\n634\\t1\\t826\\n635\\t1\\t826\\n636\\t2\\t826\\n637\\t3\\t826\\n642\\t2\\t826\\n646\\t3\\t826\\n648\\t1\\t826\\n650\\t1\\t826\\n692\\t1\\t826\\n696\\t2\\t826\\n699\\t1\\t826\\n702\\t2\\t826\\n703\\t2\\t826\\n705\\t2\\t826\\n708\\t1\\t826\\n726\\t1\\t826\\n727\\t1\\t826\\n728\\t1\\t826\\n730\\t1\\t826\\n731\\t2\\t826\\n732\\t3\\t826\\n733\\t2\\t826\\n734\\t2\\t826\\n736\\t3\\t826\\n738\\t1\\t826\\n739\\t1\\t826\\n740\\t1\\t826\\n741\\t1\\t826\\n742\\t1\\t826\\n743\\t1\\t826\\n744\\t1\\t826\\n754\\t1\\t826\\n755\\t1\\t826\\n795\\t1\\t826\\n814\\t1\\t826\\n817\\t1\\t826\\n820\\t2\\t826\\n823\\t1\\t826\\n825\\t1\\t826\\n826\\t9\\t826\\n827\\t4\\t826\\n828\\t1\\t826\\n830\\t1\\t826\\n877\\t1\\t826\\n879\\t3\\t826\\n883\\t2\\t826\\n885\\t1\\t826\\n947\\t1\\t826\\n948\\t1\\t826\\n1004\\t1\\t826\\n1017\\t1\\t826\\n1035\\t2\\t826\\n1058\\t1\\t826\\n1078\\t1\\t826\\n1089\\t1\\t826\\n1091\\t1\\t826\\n1146\\t1\\t826\\n1207\\t1\\t826\\n1230\\t1\\t826\\n1257\\t1\\t826\\n1263\\t1\\t826\\n1264\\t1\\t826\\n1297\\t1\\t826\\n1303\\t1\\t826\\n1356\\t2\\t826\\n1357\\t1\\t826\\n1364\\t1\\t826\\n1368\\t2\\t826\\n1370\\t3\\t826\\n1372\\t3\\t826\\n1373\\t1\\t826\\n1374\\t3\\t826\\n1375\\t2\\t826\\n1376\\t2\\t826\\n1377\\t2\\t826\\n1383\\t1\\t826\\n1390\\t1\\t826\\n1396\\t1\\t826\\n1405\\t1\\t826\\n1427\\t1\\t826\\n1427\\t1\\t826\\n.I 827\\n.T\\nThe Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems\\n.A\\nFarradane, J.\\n.W\\n  Methods of testing systems in practice and in theory are critically\\nreviewed.

In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much\\nfaster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university\\nlibraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high \\nproportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are \\nnow forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD \\nshows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them \\nwell established journals, widely held by libraries and with large \\ncirculations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small..\\nIt is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic\\ndifficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the \\nBLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on \\nlibraries..\\n.X\\n10\\t1\\t831\\n48\\t1\\t831\\n128\\t1\\t831\\n167\\t2\\t831\\n198\\t1\\t831\\n330\\t1\\t831\\n393\\t1\\t831\\n614\\t1\\t831\\n623\\t1\\t831\\n635\\t1\\t831\\n638\\t1\\t831\\n729\\t1\\t831\\n744\\t1\\t831\\n748\\t2\\t831\\n753\\t1\\t831\\n756\\t1\\t831\\n757\\t3\\t831\\n787\\t1\\t831\\n792\\t2\\t831\\n821\\t1\\t831\\n831\\t9\\t831\\n888\\t1\\t831\\n893\\t1\\t831\\n952\\t1\\t831\\n953\\t1\\t831\\n1083\\t1\\t831\\n1210\\t1\\t831\\n1241\\t1\\t831\\n1254\\t1\\t831\\n1256\\t1\\t831\\n1260\\t1\\t831\\n1275\\t1\\t831\\n1278\\t1\\t831\\n1302\\t1\\t831\\n1369\\t1\\t831\\n1373\\t1\\t831\\n1375\\t1\\t831\\n1376\\t1\\t831\\n1390\\t1\\t831\\n1418\\t1\\t831\\n1418\\t1\\t831\\n.I 832\\n.T\\nThe Status of \\'Practicum\\' in Graduate Library Schools\\n.A\\nGrotzinger, L.\\n.W\\n  The early schools were dedicated to practical work as a\\nnecessary component of every program; this fact is\\nheavily documented in numerous commentaries on the time.\\nAs this century progressed, however, this pioneer \\npreoccupation came under strong criticism and by the \\n1930\\'s and in more recent decades, an equally strong\\ndocumentation attacks the earlier curricula.

This leads to problems of:\\n   (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries..\\n   (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects..\\n   (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it \\n       fits as logically into one discipline as another..\\n   Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is\\nnotated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears..\\n   The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every \\nconcept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires\\nthe notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that\\nall the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they\\nbelong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes..\\nIn classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from\\nappropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the\\nfinal class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental \\nrelationships between concepts..\\n   Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be \\nseen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and \\nAttributes as its vocabulary..\\n.X\\n16\\t1\\t838\\n30\\t1\\t838\\n71\\t1\\t838\\n75\\t2\\t838\\n77\\t1\\t838\\n78\\t1\\t838\\n79\\t1\\t838\\n80\\t1\\t838\\n81\\t1\\t838\\n82\\t1\\t838\\n83\\t1\\t838\\n154\\t4\\t838\\n159\\t1\\t838\\n212\\t1\\t838\\n247\\t1\\t838\\n257\\t2\\t838\\n476\\t1\\t838\\n477\\t3\\t838\\n581\\t1\\t838\\n653\\t2\\t838\\n666\\t1\\t838\\n796\\t1\\t838\\n802\\t1\\t838\\n838\\t9\\t838\\n853\\t1\\t838\\n898\\t2\\t838\\n989\\t1\\t838\\n1074\\t2\\t838\\n1075\\t2\\t838\\n1259\\t2\\t838\\n1391\\t4\\t838\\n1393\\t1\\t838\\n1395\\t1\\t838\\n1402\\t2\\t838\\n1429\\t4\\t838\\n1430\\t4\\t838\\n1431\\t2\\t838\\n1431\\t2\\t838\\n.I 839\\n.T\\nInformation Services in University Libraries\\n.A\\nLine, M.B.\\n.W\\n  Development in university libraries in recent years in reader services,\\ninstruction in library use and subject specialization go only a small way\\nto meeting the problems created by the \"information explosion.\"  Reasons\\nwhy more dynamic and personal information services for scientists and\\nsocial scientists should be developed include the limitations in researchers\\'\\npresent use of libraries and information, the preference of users for informal\\nchannels of communication, increasing pressures on the time of university\\nteachers, and problems associated with computer retrieval systems.

The principal service offered was a manual current awareness \\nservice, based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals.\\nThe service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for each\\nreference notified, and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The\\nrelevance performance was good, and few references had been seen before; some\\nprecision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall.  The whole\\nservice was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high \\npriority among the various possible claims on university resources.

This cost analysis is conducted in the context of an investment\\ndecision, using the concept of net present value, a method not previously used \\nin library literature.. The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value\\nand a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of \\ncapital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically\\njustifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and\\nperiodical titles).. It may be that the break-even point in terms of collection\\nsize required for successful automation of serial records is smaller than has \\nbeen assumed to date..\\n.X\\n235\\t1\\t865\\n288\\t2\\t865\\n289\\t2\\t865\\n291\\t2\\t865\\n292\\t1\\t865\\n295\\t1\\t865\\n408\\t1\\t865\\n548\\t1\\t865\\n591\\t1\\t865\\n594\\t1\\t865\\n597\\t1\\t865\\n598\\t1\\t865\\n601\\t1\\t865\\n836\\t1\\t865\\n863\\t1\\t865\\n864\\t1\\t865\\n865\\t5\\t865\\n866\\t1\\t865\\n868\\t1\\t865\\n897\\t1\\t865\\n915\\t1\\t865\\n916\\t1\\t865\\n925\\t1\\t865\\n936\\t1\\t865\\n938\\t1\\t865\\n957\\t1\\t865\\n959\\t1\\t865\\n960\\t1\\t865\\n961\\t1\\t865\\n962\\t1\\t865\\n972\\t1\\t865\\n984\\t1\\t865\\n1052\\t1\\t865\\n1248\\t1\\t865\\n1353\\t1\\t865\\n1400\\t1\\t865\\n1401\\t1\\t865\\n1401\\t1\\t865\\n.I 866\\n.T\\nA MARC II - Based Program for Retrieval and Dissemination\\n.A\\nMauerhoff, Georg R.\\nSmith, Richard G.\\n.W\\n   Subscriptions to the Library of Congress\\' MARC tapes number approximately \\nsixty..

This first working paper is a statement of: 1) the obstacles that \\npresently exist which prevent the effective international interchange of\\nbibliographic data in machine-readable form; 2) the score of concern for the\\nIFLA Working Group; and 3) the definition of terms included in the broader term\\n\"content designators\"..\\n   If an international standard format can be derived, it would greatly \\nfacilitate the use in this country of machine-readable bibliographic records\\nissued by other national agencies.. It should also contribute significantly to \\nthe expansion of MARC to other languages by the Library of Congress..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t873\\n121\\t1\\t873\\n125\\t1\\t873\\n141\\t2\\t873\\n145\\t1\\t873\\n211\\t1\\t873\\n244\\t1\\t873\\n299\\t2\\t873\\n333\\t1\\t873\\n365\\t1\\t873\\n378\\t1\\t873\\n440\\t1\\t873\\n452\\t1\\t873\\n453\\t1\\t873\\n467\\t1\\t873\\n468\\t1\\t873\\n495\\t1\\t873\\n506\\t1\\t873\\n508\\t1\\t873\\n511\\t1\\t873\\n512\\t1\\t873\\n514\\t1\\t873\\n517\\t1\\t873\\n520\\t1\\t873\\n521\\t1\\t873\\n522\\t1\\t873\\n523\\t1\\t873\\n524\\t1\\t873\\n526\\t1\\t873\\n528\\t1\\t873\\n529\\t1\\t873\\n530\\t1\\t873\\n541\\t1\\t873\\n576\\t1\\t873\\n580\\t1\\t873\\n604\\t1\\t873\\n609\\t1\\t873\\n612\\t1\\t873\\n619\\t1\\t873\\n622\\t1\\t873\\n623\\t1\\t873\\n627\\t1\\t873\\n628\\t1\\t873\\n629\\t1\\t873\\n630\\t1\\t873\\n631\\t1\\t873\\n632\\t1\\t873\\n633\\t1\\t873\\n699\\t1\\t873\\n700\\t1\\t873\\n705\\t1\\t873\\n707\\t1\\t873\\n723\\t1\\t873\\n726\\t1\\t873\\n727\\t1\\t873\\n728\\t1\\t873\\n729\\t1\\t873\\n730\\t1\\t873\\n731\\t1\\t873\\n754\\t1\\t873\\n812\\t1\\t873\\n813\\t1\\t873\\n814\\t1\\t873\\n820\\t1\\t873\\n822\\t2\\t873\\n854\\t1\\t873\\n866\\t1\\t873\\n870\\t1\\t873\\n871\\t1\\t873\\n872\\t1\\t873\\n873\\t5\\t873\\n874\\t2\\t873\\n875\\t2\\t873\\n876\\t2\\t873\\n877\\t1\\t873\\n878\\t1\\t873\\n879\\t1\\t873\\n880\\t1\\t873\\n881\\t1\\t873\\n892\\t2\\t873\\n919\\t1\\t873\\n920\\t1\\t873\\n921\\t1\\t873\\n940\\t1\\t873\\n941\\t2\\t873\\n990\\t1\\t873\\n994\\t2\\t873\\n995\\t1\\t873\\n996\\t1\\t873\\n997\\t2\\t873\\n998\\t2\\t873\\n1042\\t1\\t873\\n1078\\t1\\t873\\n1079\\t2\\t873\\n1089\\t1\\t873\\n1091\\t1\\t873\\n1143\\t2\\t873\\n1153\\t1\\t873\\n1189\\t1\\t873\\n1230\\t1\\t873\\n1251\\t1\\t873\\n1257\\t1\\t873\\n1264\\t1\\t873\\n1302\\t1\\t873\\n1303\\t2\\t873\\n1351\\t1\\t873\\n1366\\t1\\t873\\n1367\\t1\\t873\\n1368\\t1\\t873\\n1396\\t3\\t873\\n1420\\t1\\t873\\n1434\\t1\\t873\\n1435\\t2\\t873\\n1436\\t1\\t873\\n1441\\t1\\t873\\n1442\\t1\\t873\\n1442\\t1\\t873\\n.I 874\\n.T\\nThe New York Public Library Automated Book Catalog Subsystem\\n.A\\nMalinconico, S.

The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as\\nit is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given \\ncollection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which\\nfunction most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those\\nwhich are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment\\nand uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by \\nnonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using \\nthe Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the \\nusual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the \\nstatistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the \\n\"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few\\ndocuments are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more\\neffective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents\\nare wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for \\nthe quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never \\nimproves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A\\ncorollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same\\naverage breadth where one indexing consists of\\nsemantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the\\nother consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that \\ntitle-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..\\n.X\\n44\\t1\\t894\\n51\\t1\\t894\\n57\\t2\\t894\\n69\\t1\\t894\\n71\\t1\\t894\\n75\\t1\\t894\\n77\\t2\\t894\\n79\\t2\\t894\\n86\\t1\\t894\\n168\\t1\\t894\\n175\\t3\\t894\\n176\\t2\\t894\\n315\\t1\\t894\\n329\\t2\\t894\\n382\\t2\\t894\\n389\\t1\\t894\\n390\\t1\\t894\\n416\\t1\\t894\\n448\\t2\\t894\\n450\\t1\\t894\\n466\\t1\\t894\\n480\\t1\\t894\\n483\\t1\\t894\\n484\\t1\\t894\\n486\\t1\\t894\\n488\\t1\\t894\\n491\\t1\\t894\\n493\\t1\\t894\\n503\\t1\\t894\\n507\\t1\\t894\\n509\\t1\\t894\\n510\\t1\\t894\\n511\\t1\\t894\\n512\\t1\\t894\\n514\\t1\\t894\\n517\\t1\\t894\\n520\\t2\\t894\\n521\\t1\\t894\\n522\\t1\\t894\\n527\\t1\\t894\\n528\\t1\\t894\\n531\\t2\\t894\\n565\\t4\\t894\\n566\\t1\\t894\\n567\\t1\\t894\\n570\\t1\\t894\\n572\\t1\\t894\\n576\\t1\\t894\\n581\\t1\\t894\\n586\\t1\\t894\\n595\\t1\\t894\\n596\\t2\\t894\\n603\\t1\\t894\\n608\\t3\\t894\\n619\\t1\\t894\\n633\\t1\\t894\\n636\\t1\\t894\\n643\\t1\\t894\\n659\\t3\\t894\\n715\\t1\\t894\\n754\\t1\\t894\\n790\\t1\\t894\\n791\\t1\\t894\\n805\\t1\\t894\\n809\\t1\\t894\\n810\\t4\\t894\\n812\\t3\\t894\\n813\\t2\\t894\\n814\\t3\\t894\\n817\\t2\\t894\\n820\\t1\\t894\\n824\\t1\\t894\\n825\\t1\\t894\\n870\\t1\\t894\\n875\\t1\\t894\\n894\\t6\\t894\\n928\\t1\\t894\\n963\\t1\\t894\\n990\\t1\\t894\\n991\\t1\\t894\\n1051\\t1\\t894\\n1255\\t1\\t894\\n1294\\t2\\t894\\n1313\\t1\\t894\\n1327\\t2\\t894\\n1413\\t1\\t894\\n1419\\t2\\t894\\n1427\\t1\\t894\\n1445\\t1\\t894\\n1445\\t1\\t894\\n.I 895\\n.T\\nDesign Equations for Retrieval System Based on the Swets Model\\n.A\\nHeine, M.

Establishment\\nof special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of\\nauthorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American\\nCataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the\\ncourse of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the\\npresence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not\\nvalid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, \\nusing the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials..\\nTherefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished,\\nthat a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship,\\nincluding compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will\\nhave the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of \\ncorporate and personal authorship..\\n.X\\n333\\t1\\t904\\n541\\t3\\t904\\n877\\t1\\t904\\n878\\t1\\t904\\n881\\t1\\t904\\n882\\t2\\t904\\n888\\t1\\t904\\n904\\t5\\t904\\n919\\t1\\t904\\n920\\t2\\t904\\n921\\t1\\t904\\n999\\t5\\t904\\n1000\\t4\\t904\\n1001\\t5\\t904\\n1002\\t5\\t904\\n1003\\t5\\t904\\n1004\\t1\\t904\\n1013\\t1\\t904\\n1060\\t1\\t904\\n1437\\t1\\t904\\n1437\\t1\\t904\\n.I 905\\n.T\\nPeriodicals for the Small Bio-Medical and Clinical Library\\n.A\\nHunt, J.W.\\n.W\\n    Since the advent of periodical literature in the seventeenth\\ncentury well over ten thousand journals have been published in\\nthe field of bio-medicine.  Many of these have ceased publication;\\nothers are only of local interest.  Still, approximately two \\nthousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currently\\nreleased.  As research and discovery are recorded in the journal\\nliterature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is its\\nsubscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomes\\na major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of\\nexperimental data available to their readers.

Bowker Company, members of the Commission and its several study\\ngroups, and many other diverse individuals within and without the library\\nworld.  The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of\\nour Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individual\\nin our society be provided with library and informational services adequate\\nto his current and emerging needs.  Confronting this goal requires a\\nrecognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, \\nrecognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite\\nfor the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.

If one ignored the major\\nhistorical resources in other languages (which few United States students read),\\nnotably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and\\nothers (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was\\nplain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental\\nneeds.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson\\'s A\\nHistory of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in\\nits second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues\\nas announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is very\\nlimited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore,\\nthe predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of\\ncrosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the\\ndevelopment of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has been\\nto tie it all together.\\n  In the present offering, \"the West\" is used conventionally: European \\ncivilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere\\nprogeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to \"cover\" even the West may\\nprove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet an\\nunderstanding of those lands \"beyond\" would be most valuable to us all.\\nLet us hope that someone will try to provide it. \\n.X\\n8\\t1\\t909\\n20\\t1\\t909\\n171\\t1\\t909\\n909\\t6\\t909\\n918\\t1\\t909\\n1061\\t1\\t909\\n1453\\t1\\t909\\n1453\\t1\\t909\\n.I 910\\n.T\\nLibraries and Neighborhood Information Centers\\n.A\\nKromes, C.L.\\n.W\\n  It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-city\\nservice that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link\\nbetween community residents and social agencies.  The major question is\\nwhether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened\\nsocial service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library in\\nthis role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation for\\nimpartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and\\nis not committed to any particular action program, community service or\\nclientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize,\\nupdate and disseminate information.\\n.X\\n248\\t1\\t910\\n340\\t1\\t910\\n376\\t1\\t910\\n431\\t1\\t910\\n910\\t5\\t910\\n935\\t1\\t910\\n939\\t1\\t910\\n1006\\t1\\t910\\n1017\\t1\\t910\\n1049\\t1\\t910\\n1145\\t2\\t910\\n1227\\t1\\t910\\n1236\\t1\\t910\\n1384\\t1\\t910\\n1396\\t1\\t910\\n1396\\t1\\t910\\n.I 911\\n.T\\nLibraries and the Organization of Knowledge\\n.A\\nShera, J.H.\\n.W\\n  From time to time, in the course of its historical development, a\\nprofessional activity enters a new stage.

S.\\n.W\\n  The International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts,\\nconvened in Copenhagen in 1969 under the auspices\\nof the IFLA Committee on Uniform Cataloguing\\nRules (later Committee on Cataloguing), set in\\nmotion the first major development in continuation\\nof the success achieved by the Paris International\\nConference on Cataloguing Principles (1961) in the\\nmatter of the principles and general rules for entry\\nand heading.  Taking under consideration the study of\\n\"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries\"\\nprepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of\\nthe Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with\\nJack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an\\ninternational standard bibliographic description for\\nmonographic publications.  There was common\\nagreement that the objective was the development of\\nspecifications for the necessary data elements, their\\norder of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit\\nthem.  These specifications should be designed to\\nsatisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and,\\nwith whatever judicious trimming might be desirable,\\nthe needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It was\\nfurther agreed that these bibliographic descriptions\\nwere to be made quite independently of the heading\\nunder which they might appear in listings.  The working\\ngroup succeeded in its task and brought forth its\\nprovisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard\\nedition was published earlier this year.  The success of\\nthis standard is manifested by the continuing increase\\nin the number of countries that have adopted it.\\n.X\\n10\\t1\\t919\\n121\\t1\\t919\\n128\\t1\\t919\\n246\\t1\\t919\\n265\\t1\\t919\\n331\\t1\\t919\\n541\\t3\\t919\\n560\\t1\\t919\\n646\\t1\\t919\\n647\\t1\\t919\\n652\\t1\\t919\\n799\\t1\\t919\\n823\\t1\\t919\\n827\\t1\\t919\\n873\\t1\\t919\\n877\\t1\\t919\\n878\\t1\\t919\\n881\\t2\\t919\\n888\\t1\\t919\\n904\\t1\\t919\\n919\\t5\\t919\\n920\\t4\\t919\\n921\\t3\\t919\\n922\\t1\\t919\\n999\\t1\\t919\\n1000\\t1\\t919\\n1001\\t1\\t919\\n1002\\t1\\t919\\n1003\\t2\\t919\\n1013\\t1\\t919\\n1291\\t1\\t919\\n1315\\t1\\t919\\n1340\\t1\\t919\\n1441\\t1\\t919\\n1445\\t2\\t919\\n1445\\t2\\t919\\n.I 920\\n.T\\nMain Entry for Serials\\n.A\\nHoward, J.H.\\n.W\\n  The nature of serials is such that, in both the ALA Cataloging Rules for \\nAuthor and Titles Entries and the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR),there\\nare special rules for choice of entry for serials that differ from the rules for \\nmonographs.

Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser found\\nthat the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938.  She reported 21\\narticles based on actual experience with the divided catalog.  A quick check of\\nher list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles. \\nShe recorded nine opponents of the divided  catalog and six better known \\nmembers of the profession reserving judgement.  Lyle in his new edition of The \\nAdministration of the College Library considers it \"safer,\" rather than \"wiser\" \\nas in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central \\nMethodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its \\ncabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion\\nwas undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be \\nconsidered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of \\ninconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing\\nof subject and title entries.  The following questions were asked of all users \\nof the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks:\\n 1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject?\\n    Were you looking under author, title, or subject?\\n 2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog?\\n 3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file?\\n  One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were \\nquestioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a \\nseparate catalog, 5 per  cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must \\nbe admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the \\nway in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the \\nUniversity of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog.\\n.X\\n57\\t1\\t928\\n75\\t1\\t928\\n176\\t1\\t928\\n202\\t1\\t928\\n209\\t2\\t928\\n276\\t1\\t928\\n326\\t1\\t928\\n329\\t1\\t928\\n565\\t1\\t928\\n572\\t1\\t928\\n595\\t1\\t928\\n596\\t1\\t928\\n608\\t1\\t928\\n619\\t1\\t928\\n810\\t1\\t928\\n812\\t1\\t928\\n813\\t1\\t928\\n814\\t1\\t928\\n870\\t1\\t928\\n891\\t1\\t928\\n894\\t1\\t928\\n928\\t5\\t928\\n963\\t2\\t928\\n965\\t1\\t928\\n973\\t4\\t928\\n990\\t1\\t928\\n991\\t1\\t928\\n1255\\t1\\t928\\n1413\\t1\\t928\\n1445\\t1\\t928\\n1445\\t1\\t928\\n.I 929\\n.T\\nThe Trading Stamp Mentality\\n.A\\nStokes, R.\\n.W\\n  A number of trips to the United States, to teach in library schools, have\\ninculcated in me a variety of views about the present state of American\\nlibrary education.

Currently a few large city\\nlibraries show slight decreases in  annual circulation, the major measure\\nof their usefulness.  Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use \\nof public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last \\ndecade.

Relatively \\nsecure in the affections of the populace, the library is nevertheless\\nfrequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and are\\nassociated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably\\nobscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for\\nthe libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because\\nthe libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were\\npreposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find that \\ntiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the \\nlibrary appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12\\nyears in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a\\ncritical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think the\\nexperience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most \\nurban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive.\\nPeriods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the \\nrichest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic \\nsuccess.

Perhaps the most constructive single thing\\nthat could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three\\npublishers of a library periodical to cease publication.\\n  One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so much\\npublic wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chief\\nadvocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print.  Instead\\nwe find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed \\nprocreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and \\ntechnology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of little\\nconsequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organization\\nwithin the loose boundaries of our  profession, decides, virtually at the\\nmoment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of its\\nown - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its \\npresence to the world at large.\\n.X\\n162\\t1\\t933\\n171\\t1\\t933\\n398\\t1\\t933\\n933\\t6\\t933\\n1076\\t2\\t933\\n1275\\t1\\t933\\n1275\\t1\\t933\\n.I 934\\n.T\\nLibrary Education and the Public Library\\n.A\\nGarrison, G.\\n.W\\n  A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always\\nbeen that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains\\nfor current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately,\\nthe picture many faculty members have of what today\\'s\\nrequirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates \\nare thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we fail\\neven to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past and\\ntrain people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public\\nlibraries.   Library education, like the public\\nlibrary itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of\\noblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position\\nof relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will wither\\naway, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.

Time\\'s passage has replaced the\\nmonarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost \\nhas attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs\\nmay stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the \\nprofession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost \\naccounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few\\nsimple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in\\nshort - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis.\\n  In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related\\nprocedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success\\nover the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the \\nfindings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of \\nyour own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate \\nrequirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the \\nsix steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to \\nidentifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, \\nthese ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful \\nfor your internal operations and may be significant for your library\\'s future.\\n.X\\n90\\t1\\t938\\n231\\t1\\t938\\n249\\t1\\t938\\n250\\t1\\t938\\n261\\t1\\t938\\n288\\t1\\t938\\n289\\t1\\t938\\n295\\t2\\t938\\n299\\t1\\t938\\n334\\t1\\t938\\n354\\t1\\t938\\n365\\t1\\t938\\n408\\t1\\t938\\n608\\t1\\t938\\n610\\t1\\t938\\n617\\t1\\t938\\n620\\t1\\t938\\n815\\t1\\t938\\n865\\t1\\t938\\n938\\t5\\t938\\n939\\t1\\t938\\n959\\t1\\t938\\n974\\t1\\t938\\n984\\t1\\t938\\n991\\t1\\t938\\n992\\t1\\t938\\n1221\\t1\\t938\\n1317\\t1\\t938\\n1318\\t1\\t938\\n1352\\t1\\t938\\n1365\\t1\\t938\\n1390\\t1\\t938\\n1390\\t1\\t938\\n.I 939\\n.T\\nThe Paradoxes of Library Cooperation\\n.A\\nDougherty, R.M.\\n.W\\n  The need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized, as countless\\narticles written within the past decade will attest.

This percentage\\nfalls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100-bed capacity are considered\\n(1,990 libraries in 3,318 hospitals).  In the 4,191 libraries, one or more\\nfull-time staff members were found in only 1,054 (25 percent).  In even\\nfewer, 928, was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian.\\nClearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform\\nproperly their functions of health education and patient care.\\n  By \"community hospital\" we mean the nonfederal, short-term hospital\\nproviding general and selected special services, the hospital located at some\\ndistance from a large medical center and without teaching and research\\nprograms, such as a nursing school or internships.  Though the librarians\\nof more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study\\nof this book, it is written primarily for an audience of untrained, probably\\nnewly employed, individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital\\'s\\nlibrary and do not know where to begin.\\n.X\\n192\\t2\\t949\\n215\\t2\\t949\\n221\\t1\\t949\\n410\\t2\\t949\\n949\\t9\\t949\\n1071\\t4\\t949\\n1147\\t1\\t949\\n1147\\t1\\t949\\n.I 950\\n.T\\nThe Crisis in Cataloging\\n.A\\nOsborn, A.D.\\n.W\\n  A wise German librarian has linked the library administrator\\nand the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy\\nin work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library\\'s\\nresources.  This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of \\ncooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards.\\nIt is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectives\\nsetting limitations in such a way that more values will not be\\ndestroyed than are created.\\n  This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled \"Tasks for the\\nfuture.\"  There was a time, and not so very far back, when the\\nlibrary administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.  In\\nthe more immediate past, however, the two have become separated,\\nso that their closer collaboration does need to be set down\\nas a task for the future, the immediate future at that.\\nMany new problems of administration have served to busy the\\nadministrator, and most catalogers have had more work than\\nenough, with the result that administrators have come to know\\nless and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know\\nless and less about general library administration.  The situation\\nnow is that the administrator will be forced to pay more\\nattention to cataloging because it has become a major problem\\nfield.\\n.X\\n92\\t2\\t950\\n235\\t1\\t950\\n246\\t2\\t950\\n247\\t1\\t950\\n262\\t1\\t950\\n326\\t1\\t950\\n333\\t2\\t950\\n825\\t1\\t950\\n883\\t1\\t950\\n930\\t1\\t950\\n940\\t1\\t950\\n941\\t2\\t950\\n950\\t5\\t950\\n978\\t3\\t950\\n988\\t1\\t950\\n991\\t1\\t950\\n996\\t1\\t950\\n997\\t2\\t950\\n1000\\t1\\t950\\n1079\\t1\\t950\\n1153\\t1\\t950\\n1216\\t2\\t950\\n1266\\t1\\t950\\n1395\\t1\\t950\\n1441\\t1\\t950\\n1441\\t1\\t950\\n.I 951\\n.T\\nThe Historical Background of Departmental and Collegiate Libraries\\n.A\\nThompson, L.\\n.W\\n  In spite of the great volume of material dealing with\\ndepartmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in\\nlibrary periodicals and books on university and college\\nlibrary administration, there has been relatively little original\\nthought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to\\nprovide an adequate background for solution of problems which\\nhave their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literature\\nhas been either repetition of the old arguments for and against\\nthis type of library organization or statements of how this or\\nthat institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except for\\ncontemporary accounts of early American scholars describing the\\nattempts to transplant the German seminar library to American\\nsoil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is no\\naccount of the conditions which brought about and for many\\nyears invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation of\\ntrends in the history of departmental libraries over the last\\nthree-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement\\nto other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators\\nwho are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, or\\namalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution.\\n.X\\n96\\t1\\t951\\n297\\t1\\t951\\n298\\t1\\t951\\n304\\t1\\t951\\n951\\t5\\t951\\n952\\t1\\t951\\n1183\\t1\\t951\\n1339\\t1\\t951\\n1365\\t1\\t951\\n1365\\t1\\t951\\n.I 952\\n.T\\nCharacteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists\\nand Physicists in the United States\\n.A\\nFussler, H.H.\\n.W\\n  The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural\\nconsequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of \\nknowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and\\nmore knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of\\ntheir clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the\\nincreasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The \\nprocesses of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have \\nbecome increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes\\nare of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library\\nis, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its\\npredecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries\\nthat is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished\\nfrom the costs of its purchase or its direct\\nservicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when\\nnearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing\\nmaterial, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!\\n.X\\n14\\t1\\t952\\n19\\t1\\t952\\n31\\t1\\t952\\n36\\t1\\t952\\n37\\t2\\t952\\n39\\t1\\t952\\n40\\t1\\t952\\n41\\t1\\t952\\n46\\t1\\t952\\n47\\t1\\t952\\n48\\t1\\t952\\n88\\t1\\t952\\n96\\t1\\t952\\n97\\t1\\t952\\n102\\t1\\t952\\n103\\t1\\t952\\n132\\t1\\t952\\n137\\t1\\t952\\n167\\t1\\t952\\n181\\t1\\t952\\n182\\t1\\t952\\n183\\t1\\t952\\n184\\t1\\t952\\n189\\t1\\t952\\n193\\t1\\t952\\n195\\t1\\t952\\n198\\t2\\t952\\n201\\t1\\t952\\n221\\t1\\t952\\n233\\t1\\t952\\n237\\t1\\t952\\n253\\t1\\t952\\n255\\t1\\t952\\n269\\t1\\t952\\n272\\t1\\t952\\n297\\t1\\t952\\n298\\t1\\t952\\n313\\t1\\t952\\n359\\t2\\t952\\n377\\t1\\t952\\n379\\t1\\t952\\n395\\t2\\t952\\n415\\t2\\t952\\n505\\t1\\t952\\n543\\t1\\t952\\n560\\t1\\t952\\n573\\t1\\t952\\n614\\t2\\t952\\n618\\t1\\t952\\n632\\t1\\t952\\n635\\t2\\t952\\n638\\t2\\t952\\n667\\t1\\t952\\n735\\t1\\t952\\n748\\t3\\t952\\n749\\t1\\t952\\n751\\t1\\t952\\n753\\t1\\t952\\n756\\t1\\t952\\n757\\t1\\t952\\n760\\t1\\t952\\n764\\t1\\t952\\n765\\t1\\t952\\n767\\t3\\t952\\n772\\t1\\t952\\n774\\t1\\t952\\n775\\t1\\t952\\n777\\t1\\t952\\n778\\t2\\t952\\n782\\t1\\t952\\n787\\t1\\t952\\n792\\t1\\t952\\n804\\t1\\t952\\n805\\t1\\t952\\n821\\t1\\t952\\n831\\t1\\t952\\n891\\t1\\t952\\n893\\t1\\t952\\n905\\t2\\t952\\n951\\t1\\t952\\n952\\t10\\t952\\n953\\t4\\t952\\n958\\t1\\t952\\n964\\t1\\t952\\n968\\t1\\t952\\n1009\\t1\\t952\\n1016\\t1\\t952\\n1018\\t1\\t952\\n1019\\t1\\t952\\n1030\\t1\\t952\\n1061\\t1\\t952\\n1071\\t1\\t952\\n1083\\t1\\t952\\n1085\\t1\\t952\\n1086\\t2\\t952\\n1087\\t1\\t952\\n1182\\t1\\t952\\n1200\\t1\\t952\\n1210\\t2\\t952\\n1235\\t1\\t952\\n1240\\t1\\t952\\n1254\\t1\\t952\\n1256\\t1\\t952\\n1260\\t3\\t952\\n1274\\t1\\t952\\n1275\\t6\\t952\\n1276\\t2\\t952\\n1277\\t1\\t952\\n1278\\t2\\t952\\n1280\\t2\\t952\\n1287\\t1\\t952\\n1301\\t1\\t952\\n1302\\t6\\t952\\n1304\\t1\\t952\\n1313\\t1\\t952\\n1338\\t1\\t952\\n1339\\t1\\t952\\n1344\\t1\\t952\\n1347\\t1\\t952\\n1359\\t1\\t952\\n1365\\t1\\t952\\n1369\\t1\\t952\\n1373\\t1\\t952\\n1380\\t1\\t952\\n1397\\t1\\t952\\n1417\\t1\\t952\\n1418\\t1\\t952\\n1428\\t1\\t952\\n1444\\t1\\t952\\n1444\\t1\\t952\\n.I 953\\n.T\\nCharacteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists and\\nPhysicists in The United States, Part II\\n.A\\nFussler, H.H.\\n.W\\n  This is the second of two papers dealing with the characteristics of the\\nliterature used by research chemists and physicists in the United States.  \\nThe method of the study was fully outlined in th first article and will\\ntherefore not be repeated here.

Compared to other types of societies, this one\\ndemands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much\\npressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual \\nin his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a \\nradical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern\\nindustrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists \\nanticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills \\nof a high order.\\n  Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to\\nrise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same \\ncompetition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income.\\n.X\\n22\\t1\\t954\\n230\\t1\\t954\\n237\\t1\\t954\\n301\\t1\\t954\\n348\\t1\\t954\\n923\\t1\\t954\\n934\\t1\\t954\\n954\\t9\\t954\\n1056\\t1\\t954\\n1333\\t1\\t954\\n1423\\t1\\t954\\n1423\\t1\\t954\\n.I 955\\n.T\\nInterrelations among Special Librarys\\n.A\\nBudington, W.S.\\n.W\\n  The present paper will first deal with some of the objectives, etiology, and\\nrequirements of the library network as it overtakes and embraces co-operation.\\nNext, in this context of network development, a number of activities\\ninvolving special libraries will be reviewed by way of illustration and \\nexample.

This requires the use of decision rules which permit \\nlibrary resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest \\nreturns.. An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest\\nwhich groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society..\\n   An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information,\\nand leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward \\neducational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are \\ninvolved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of \\nschool-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages \\nminority groups and governmental officials and staff..\\n   Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same\\nservices, it is an uneconomic use of the communities\\' resources to maintain two\\nseparate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are \\nforced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies..\\n.X\\n5\\t1\\t957\\n74\\t1\\t957\\n83\\t1\\t957\\n90\\t1\\t957\\n91\\t1\\t957\\n158\\t1\\t957\\n222\\t1\\t957\\n223\\t1\\t957\\n245\\t1\\t957\\n273\\t1\\t957\\n279\\t1\\t957\\n288\\t2\\t957\\n291\\t1\\t957\\n292\\t1\\t957\\n331\\t1\\t957\\n368\\t1\\t957\\n381\\t1\\t957\\n408\\t1\\t957\\n435\\t1\\t957\\n490\\t1\\t957\\n496\\t1\\t957\\n591\\t2\\t957\\n592\\t1\\t957\\n615\\t1\\t957\\n723\\t1\\t957\\n724\\t1\\t957\\n815\\t1\\t957\\n834\\t1\\t957\\n860\\t1\\t957\\n865\\t1\\t957\\n915\\t1\\t957\\n925\\t2\\t957\\n957\\t5\\t957\\n959\\t2\\t957\\n960\\t1\\t957\\n961\\t1\\t957\\n962\\t2\\t957\\n972\\t1\\t957\\n976\\t1\\t957\\n984\\t1\\t957\\n1005\\t1\\t957\\n1018\\t1\\t957\\n1023\\t1\\t957\\n1148\\t1\\t957\\n1149\\t1\\t957\\n1219\\t1\\t957\\n1227\\t3\\t957\\n1317\\t1\\t957\\n1333\\t1\\t957\\n1353\\t2\\t957\\n1359\\t1\\t957\\n1360\\t1\\t957\\n1365\\t1\\t957\\n1390\\t1\\t957\\n1400\\t2\\t957\\n1401\\t1\\t957\\n1410\\t1\\t957\\n1424\\t1\\t957\\n1424\\t1\\t957\\n.I 958\\n.T\\nThe Review Article: Its Characteristics and Problems\\n.A\\nVirgo, Julie A.\\n.W\\n   The characteristics and problems associated with the review literature in the\\nsciences were examined..

These models describe the\\namount of use made of resources by a user in a visit, the distribution of book\\ncirculation in a collection, the dependence of circulation on time, and the \\neffect of multiple copies on user satisfaction.. Predictions are made on the \\nbasis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into \\nbranch libraries.. The effect, in terms of frustrated use, of removing the \\nleast-used books from a collection is discussed, as are strategies for for\\nduplication..

The study was carefully designed to provide a representative sample of\\ncatalog use.. Traffic through the catalog area was observed over a period of more\\nthan a year.. A schedule of interviews with catalog users was based on observed \\ntraffic volume by hour of day, day of week, and time of year.. More than 1,000 \\ninterviews were completed, using nonleading interviewing technique.. Information\\nwas derived on the catalog user\\'s objective, starting clues, and university\\naffiliation.. Search success was determined.. Follow-up studies were performed \\non the catalog cards and the actual books identified in successful searches.. \\nReasons for search failure were determined for know-item searches..

Thus, well-designed experiments should permit judging the relative\\nmerits of different classification schemes. This notion, although self-evident, \\nhad remarkably little impact on the field of\\nlibrary science prior to the 1950\\'s.  During that decade, the first controlled\\nexperiments on information retrieval were performed, and these mark a turning\\npoint in the history of classification research.  For the first time, \\nexperimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical \\nimportance to indexing and classification.

He questions its advocates\\' claim\\nthat it best meets a library\\'s needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as\\nthe one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog\\ncan more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject\\nfields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography\\n(Harris, 1957).  Fletcher\\'s article seems to have been followed by more\\nthan thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject\\nof the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some\\ndivisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the\\ngreatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the\\nliterature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year\\nin which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.\\n.X\\n202\\t1\\t973\\n209\\t2\\t973\\n276\\t2\\t973\\n326\\t1\\t973\\n891\\t1\\t973\\n928\\t4\\t973\\n963\\t1\\t973\\n965\\t1\\t973\\n973\\t6\\t973\\n973\\t6\\t973\\n.I 974\\n.T\\nCost Survey:\\nCost of Ordering, Cataloging, and Preparations in Southern California\\nLibraries\\n.A\\nMacQuarrie, C.\\n.W\\n   It was our original intention to include the cost of book selection with\\nthe cost of ordering, as part of the total acquisition process.  We also\\nattempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few of\\nthe libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct\\ncost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics\\nwere extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the\\nlibraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian\\nperforming most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly\\nhigh and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion.\\n.X\\n249\\t1\\t974\\n250\\t1\\t974\\n331\\t1\\t974\\n365\\t1\\t974\\n408\\t1\\t974\\n834\\t1\\t974\\n848\\t1\\t974\\n849\\t1\\t974\\n922\\t1\\t974\\n938\\t1\\t974\\n974\\t5\\t974\\n984\\t2\\t974\\n997\\t1\\t974\\n1317\\t1\\t974\\n1359\\t1\\t974\\n1359\\t1\\t974\\n.I 975\\n.T\\nWhy Allocate?\\n.A\\nBach, H.\\n.W\\n  Most academic librarians will no doubt agree with Lyle\\'s\\nstatement that the book fund is one of the most important items\\nin the library budget.

While public and college libraries may have  \\nseveral decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a\\nbuilding or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are\\nnot overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrial\\nfloorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the\\npossible future growth of the library.\\tWeeding or storage requirements,\\ntherefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial\\nlibrary administrators than they are to administrators of other types of\\nlibraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the\\nserials collections of industrial libraries because so much current\\ntechnical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. \\nThese collections grow rapidly.

By this\\naction, the Congress took two most important steps to aid libraries of\\nhigher education in the United States: (1) it fully recognized for the\\nfirst time, the importance of granting Federal aid and assistance toward\\nsolving the problem of cataloging in this country; and (2) it gave the\\nLibrary of Congress a clear mandate to provide new and unparalleled\\nservices for the benefit of academic and research libraries of this country.  \\n.X\\n92\\t1\\t978\\n200\\t1\\t978\\n246\\t1\\t978\\n262\\t1\\t978\\n825\\t1\\t978\\n883\\t1\\t978\\n930\\t1\\t978\\n940\\t1\\t978\\n941\\t2\\t978\\n950\\t3\\t978\\n978\\t5\\t978\\n988\\t1\\t978\\n996\\t1\\t978\\n997\\t1\\t978\\n1079\\t1\\t978\\n1216\\t1\\t978\\n1252\\t1\\t978\\n1252\\t1\\t978\\n.I 979\\n.T\\nAutomated Acquisitions Procedures at the University of Michigan Library\\n.A\\nDunlap, C.\\n.W\\n  In June 1965, the Acquisitions Department of The University of\\nMichigan Library began using a computer-based system for ordering\\nbooks and other library materials.

Over\\ntwo hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and \\npopular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world,\\nand in a variety of library journals.  The publicity that has attended this\\nproject has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an\\nexaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only\\nmade the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the\\nexamination of MEDLARS\\' real accomplishments.  There has to date been very\\nlittle careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50\\npercent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin\\'s report,\\nand virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons\\nclosely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS\\nsystem.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall\\nvalue cannot help but be colored by this connection.\\n.X\\n38\\t1\\t986\\n84\\t1\\t986\\n119\\t1\\t986\\n147\\t1\\t986\\n210\\t1\\t986\\n213\\t1\\t986\\n214\\t2\\t986\\n218\\t1\\t986\\n241\\t1\\t986\\n250\\t1\\t986\\n340\\t1\\t986\\n348\\t1\\t986\\n355\\t1\\t986\\n375\\t1\\t986\\n381\\t1\\t986\\n382\\t1\\t986\\n408\\t1\\t986\\n488\\t1\\t986\\n489\\t1\\t986\\n490\\t1\\t986\\n491\\t2\\t986\\n492\\t1\\t986\\n493\\t1\\t986\\n494\\t1\\t986\\n495\\t1\\t986\\n496\\t1\\t986\\n497\\t1\\t986\\n499\\t1\\t986\\n500\\t1\\t986\\n506\\t1\\t986\\n581\\t1\\t986\\n583\\t1\\t986\\n584\\t1\\t986\\n586\\t2\\t986\\n591\\t1\\t986\\n603\\t1\\t986\\n608\\t1\\t986\\n610\\t1\\t986\\n659\\t1\\t986\\n676\\t1\\t986\\n696\\t1\\t986\\n763\\t1\\t986\\n788\\t1\\t986\\n795\\t1\\t986\\n801\\t1\\t986\\n855\\t1\\t986\\n916\\t1\\t986\\n986\\t6\\t986\\n1012\\t2\\t986\\n1050\\t1\\t986\\n1084\\t1\\t986\\n1188\\t1\\t986\\n1254\\t1\\t986\\n1291\\t1\\t986\\n1294\\t1\\t986\\n1379\\t1\\t986\\n1404\\t1\\t986\\n1404\\t1\\t986\\n.I 987\\n.T\\nCIP in Mid-1970\\n.A\\nClapp, Verner W.\\n.W\\n   The history of the near-success of the 1958-59 experiment with cataloging in\\nsource and the subsequent refusal of the library community to accept its failure\\nare punctuated by data from a recent survey of 591 libraries in IS categories\\nregarding attitudes toward prepublication cataloging..\\n.X\\n63\\t1\\t987\\n91\\t1\\t987\\n175\\t1\\t987\\n348\\t1\\t987\\n389\\t1\\t987\\n390\\t1\\t987\\n429\\t1\\t987\\n487\\t1\\t987\\n502\\t1\\t987\\n513\\t1\\t987\\n579\\t1\\t987\\n582\\t1\\t987\\n588\\t1\\t987\\n589\\t1\\t987\\n596\\t1\\t987\\n600\\t1\\t987\\n601\\t1\\t987\\n603\\t1\\t987\\n613\\t1\\t987\\n614\\t1\\t987\\n618\\t1\\t987\\n657\\t1\\t987\\n685\\t1\\t987\\n686\\t1\\t987\\n691\\t1\\t987\\n721\\t1\\t987\\n722\\t1\\t987\\n724\\t1\\t987\\n725\\t1\\t987\\n799\\t1\\t987\\n805\\t1\\t987\\n807\\t1\\t987\\n863\\t1\\t987\\n864\\t1\\t987\\n930\\t1\\t987\\n956\\t1\\t987\\n958\\t1\\t987\\n963\\t1\\t987\\n987\\t5\\t987\\n988\\t5\\t987\\n989\\t1\\t987\\n1000\\t1\\t987\\n1152\\t1\\t987\\n1208\\t1\\t987\\n1265\\t1\\t987\\n1293\\t1\\t987\\n1294\\t1\\t987\\n1302\\t1\\t987\\n1327\\t1\\t987\\n1434\\t1\\t987\\n1434\\t1\\t987\\n.I 988\\n.T\\nReport on Library of Congress Plans for Cataloging in Publication\\n.A\\nWelsh, W.J.\\n.W\\n  When we were asked in October 1969 for an expression of attitude\\nabout a renewal of cataloging-in-source, our response was positive.\\nWe were interested and we were determined to make it succeed.

Its on-line \\nshared cataloging system has been operational since 18 October 1971,and utilizes\\ncathode ray tube terminals located in the center\\'s fifty-three member \\nlibraries.. These terminals are connected to the Sigma 5 computer in Columbus by\\na multiple line, multiple party synchronous transmission telephone network.. \\nBetween January and June 1972 the system operated at an annual rate of 500,000 \\nworks cataloged and over 3,400,000 catalog cards produced .. These cards are\\nindividualized to fit the requirements of each member and are produced in packs\\ndesignated for particular catalogs..\\n.X\\n79\\t1\\t997\\n92\\t2\\t997\\n141\\t2\\t997\\n178\\t1\\t997\\n235\\t1\\t997\\n244\\t1\\t997\\n246\\t2\\t997\\n247\\t1\\t997\\n299\\t2\\t997\\n326\\t1\\t997\\n333\\t2\\t997\\n361\\t1\\t997\\n365\\t1\\t997\\n382\\t1\\t997\\n522\\t1\\t997\\n529\\t1\\t997\\n530\\t1\\t997\\n608\\t1\\t997\\n627\\t1\\t997\\n628\\t1\\t997\\n630\\t1\\t997\\n822\\t1\\t997\\n825\\t2\\t997\\n854\\t1\\t997\\n871\\t1\\t997\\n872\\t2\\t997\\n873\\t2\\t997\\n874\\t2\\t997\\n875\\t2\\t997\\n876\\t2\\t997\\n877\\t1\\t997\\n878\\t1\\t997\\n879\\t1\\t997\\n880\\t1\\t997\\n883\\t1\\t997\\n892\\t2\\t997\\n930\\t1\\t997\\n940\\t1\\t997\\n941\\t3\\t997\\n950\\t2\\t997\\n966\\t1\\t997\\n974\\t1\\t997\\n978\\t1\\t997\\n988\\t1\\t997\\n990\\t1\\t997\\n991\\t1\\t997\\n994\\t2\\t997\\n995\\t1\\t997\\n996\\t1\\t997\\n997\\t10\\t997\\n998\\t2\\t997\\n1000\\t1\\t997\\n1071\\t1\\t997\\n1079\\t3\\t997\\n1143\\t1\\t997\\n1153\\t2\\t997\\n1189\\t1\\t997\\n1216\\t3\\t997\\n1230\\t1\\t997\\n1251\\t1\\t997\\n1252\\t1\\t997\\n1257\\t1\\t997\\n1266\\t2\\t997\\n1303\\t1\\t997\\n1351\\t1\\t997\\n1371\\t1\\t997\\n1395\\t2\\t997\\n1396\\t2\\t997\\n1420\\t1\\t997\\n1421\\t1\\t997\\n1434\\t1\\t997\\n1435\\t2\\t997\\n1436\\t1\\t997\\n1441\\t1\\t997\\n1442\\t1\\t997\\n1442\\t1\\t997\\n.I 998\\n.T\\nThe Other Half of Cataloging\\n.A\\nOhmes, Frances\\n.A\\nJones, J. F.\\n.W\\n   The authors investigate the impact of a bibliographic retrieval/card\\nproduction system, such as the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), with special\\nattention to its role in cataloging.. Activities required at the local level to\\nmake the LC card a functioning component of the catalog are described.. The\\ncharacteristics of the ensuring workload are examined, along with methods of\\naccomplishing it.. These activities are seen as a factor in the persistence of\\nbacklogs.. The design of OCLC, because of the immobility of the terminal and\\nthe absence of the catalog from the data base, by-passes this workload, leaving \\nthe local library to accomplish it by the method of its choice, as before, or \\nto leave it undone..\\n.X\\n141\\t2\\t998\\n244\\t1\\t998\\n299\\t2\\t998\\n333\\t1\\t998\\n354\\t1\\t998\\n365\\t1\\t998\\n522\\t1\\t998\\n529\\t1\\t998\\n530\\t1\\t998\\n627\\t1\\t998\\n628\\t1\\t998\\n630\\t1\\t998\\n822\\t1\\t998\\n854\\t1\\t998\\n871\\t1\\t998\\n872\\t1\\t998\\n873\\t2\\t998\\n874\\t3\\t998\\n875\\t2\\t998\\n876\\t2\\t998\\n877\\t1\\t998\\n878\\t1\\t998\\n879\\t1\\t998\\n880\\t1\\t998\\n882\\t1\\t998\\n884\\t1\\t998\\n886\\t1\\t998\\n887\\t1\\t998\\n892\\t3\\t998\\n940\\t1\\t998\\n941\\t2\\t998\\n990\\t1\\t998\\n994\\t2\\t998\\n995\\t1\\t998\\n996\\t1\\t998\\n997\\t2\\t998\\n998\\t6\\t998\\n1079\\t2\\t998\\n1143\\t1\\t998\\n1153\\t1\\t998\\n1189\\t1\\t998\\n1230\\t1\\t998\\n1251\\t1\\t998\\n1257\\t1\\t998\\n1303\\t1\\t998\\n1351\\t1\\t998\\n1395\\t1\\t998\\n1396\\t2\\t998\\n1420\\t1\\t998\\n1434\\t1\\t998\\n1435\\t2\\t998\\n1436\\t1\\t998\\n1442\\t1\\t998\\n1442\\t1\\t998\\n.I 999\\n.T\\nThe Impact of International Standardization on the Rules of Entry for Serials\\n.A\\nCannan, Judith Proctor\\n.W\\n   The major provisions of the International Serials Data Systems and the \\nInternational Standard Bibliographic Description for Serials are presented and \\nrelated to present rules of entry for serials as detailed in the \\nAnglo-American Cataloging Rules..\\n.X\\n141\\t1\\t999\\n333\\t1\\t999\\n363\\t1\\t999\\n409\\t1\\t999\\n541\\t3\\t999\\n645\\t1\\t999\\n647\\t1\\t999\\n651\\t1\\t999\\n739\\t1\\t999\\n877\\t1\\t999\\n878\\t1\\t999\\n881\\t2\\t999\\n882\\t3\\t999\\n883\\t1\\t999\\n884\\t1\\t999\\n885\\t1\\t999\\n886\\t1\\t999\\n887\\t1\\t999\\n888\\t1\\t999\\n904\\t5\\t999\\n917\\t1\\t999\\n919\\t1\\t999\\n920\\t2\\t999\\n921\\t1\\t999\\n999\\t6\\t999\\n1000\\t5\\t999\\n1001\\t6\\t999\\n1002\\t6\\t999\\n1003\\t6\\t999\\n1004\\t2\\t999\\n1013\\t1\\t999\\n1060\\t1\\t999\\n1375\\t1\\t999\\n1376\\t1\\t999\\n1437\\t1\\t999\\n1437\\t1\\t999\\n.I 1000\\n.T\\nSerial Cataloging Problems: Rules of Entry and Definition of Title\\n.A\\nSimonton, Wesley\\n.W\\n   Alternatives to the present rule for entry of serials in the Anglo-American\\nCataloging Rules (AACR) are identified and arguments relating to the concept of\\nauthorship for serials are summarized..

In fact, the \\nliterature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized \\nliterature of review.\\n        Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with \\nother library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and\\ncataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little\\nagreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an\\nintegral part of reference work because many reference librarians\\nare responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books\\nand libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The\\npreparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus \\n\"reference librarian\" does, how can one readily determine the\\neffectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians\\nmay have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a\\nproblem, but it is undeniably a big one.\\n.X\\n274\\t1\\t1008\\n298\\t1\\t1008\\n303\\t1\\t1008\\n353\\t1\\t1008\\n364\\t1\\t1008\\n470\\t2\\t1008\\n1008\\t7\\t1008\\n1017\\t2\\t1008\\n1049\\t2\\t1008\\n1247\\t1\\t1008\\n1263\\t1\\t1008\\n1353\\t1\\t1008\\n1357\\t1\\t1008\\n1357\\t1\\t1008\\n.I 1009\\n.T\\nService to Industry and Research Parks by College and University Libraries\\n.A\\nNicholson, N.N.\\n.W\\n  The phrase \"research parks\" in the title of this article recalls\\nEugene B.

The concept of a national network implies\\nthe interconnection of existing information systems and libraries\\nthrough communications.

It is usually necessary to establish\\na committee or group of professional people who determine, usually by \\nenumeration, those volumes that should be included in the core collection.\\nOften the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions of\\nthe individuals, and although valid in many cases as desirable reading, the\\ncore collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements.\\n.X\\n14\\t1\\t1019\\n31\\t2\\t1019\\n33\\t1\\t1019\\n36\\t1\\t1019\\n41\\t1\\t1019\\n46\\t4\\t1019\\n123\\t1\\t1019\\n131\\t1\\t1019\\n153\\t1\\t1019\\n170\\t1\\t1019\\n181\\t1\\t1019\\n182\\t1\\t1019\\n183\\t1\\t1019\\n184\\t1\\t1019\\n193\\t1\\t1019\\n195\\t1\\t1019\\n198\\t1\\t1019\\n201\\t2\\t1019\\n223\\t1\\t1019\\n266\\t1\\t1019\\n267\\t2\\t1019\\n269\\t2\\t1019\\n271\\t1\\t1019\\n280\\t2\\t1019\\n290\\t1\\t1019\\n359\\t1\\t1019\\n373\\t1\\t1019\\n379\\t1\\t1019\\n395\\t1\\t1019\\n415\\t1\\t1019\\n475\\t1\\t1019\\n550\\t1\\t1019\\n614\\t1\\t1019\\n634\\t1\\t1019\\n638\\t1\\t1019\\n651\\t1\\t1019\\n748\\t2\\t1019\\n751\\t1\\t1019\\n760\\t1\\t1019\\n765\\t1\\t1019\\n767\\t1\\t1019\\n774\\t1\\t1019\\n778\\t2\\t1019\\n786\\t1\\t1019\\n791\\t2\\t1019\\n793\\t1\\t1019\\n800\\t1\\t1019\\n804\\t1\\t1019\\n811\\t1\\t1019\\n891\\t1\\t1019\\n905\\t1\\t1019\\n925\\t3\\t1019\\n948\\t1\\t1019\\n952\\t1\\t1019\\n953\\t1\\t1019\\n964\\t1\\t1019\\n968\\t1\\t1019\\n983\\t1\\t1019\\n1009\\t1\\t1019\\n1018\\t1\\t1019\\n1019\\t9\\t1019\\n1028\\t1\\t1019\\n1037\\t1\\t1019\\n1086\\t1\\t1019\\n1090\\t1\\t1019\\n1173\\t1\\t1019\\n1203\\t1\\t1019\\n1240\\t1\\t1019\\n1359\\t1\\t1019\\n1397\\t1\\t1019\\n1400\\t1\\t1019\\n1416\\t2\\t1019\\n1417\\t3\\t1019\\n1424\\t1\\t1019\\n1424\\t1\\t1019\\n.I 1020\\n.T\\nIFLA - Communications - FIAB\\n.A\\nHumphreys, K.\\n.W\\n  The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries,\\napart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposed\\nby the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, which\\nin university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was not\\nconsidered to be of comparable importance with the major department --\\nthe cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions would\\nbe concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or\\nofficial documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely\\nautonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staff\\nwere mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in\\nanswering queries of a very specialized nature on the library\\'s collections,\\nespecially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with the\\ngeneral bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-day\\nreference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to become\\nexpert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part\\nin the activities of another.. Divisions between the various \\nkinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library\\'s\\norganization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that this\\nis a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach.\\nNonetheless this conservative view of the library\\'s function tended to freeze\\nthe administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject field\\noften undertook research in the subject outside the library and might\\noccasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his\\nfield, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection\\nwith his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer,\\norientalist or linguist.\\n   The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete\\nre-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond\\nthe bounds of the old departments.\\n.X\\n11\\t1\\t1020\\n143\\t1\\t1020\\n268\\t1\\t1020\\n305\\t1\\t1020\\n818\\t1\\t1020\\n843\\t2\\t1020\\n844\\t1\\t1020\\n845\\t1\\t1020\\n961\\t1\\t1020\\n1020\\t5\\t1020\\n1021\\t1\\t1020\\n1058\\t1\\t1020\\n1233\\t1\\t1020\\n1253\\t1\\t1020\\n1401\\t1\\t1020\\n1401\\t1\\t1020\\n.I 1021\\n.T\\nThe Subject Specialist in National and University Libraries,\\nwith Special Reference to Book Selection\\n.A\\nDanton, J.P.\\n.W\\n  Of the world\\'s numerous kinds of libraries, the national and the university\\nmay properly be characterized as having responsibilities for both general and\\nuniversal or nearly universal collecting in the realm of scholarship.

It is this twin aspect of the\\nactivity of these scholarly libraries - collecting simultaneously in breadth\\nand in depth - which produces most of their major problems.

Production of monographs and journals, research reports and government\\ndocuments has been increasing exponentially to the point that British\\nuniversity librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of space\\nwhich their American counterparts have been struggling with for a number\\nof years (judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in American\\nlibrary journals).  The force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat\\nmitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds\\navailable for book purchasing, and by the increasing price of books.

The orientation is toward a formal\\ndefinition of behavioral elements in an individual\\'s \"purposeful state\":\\nspecifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each\\nobjective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of\\naction in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each\\ncourse of action.\\n  The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in\\nterms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action.\\nThe amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the\\namount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the\\namount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message.  The amount\\nof instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies\\nof the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in\\nterms of the values of the objectives.\\tThe amounts of instruction and \\nmotivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the\\namounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.\\n  The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of\\nthe amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount of\\nmotivation in the state.  This concept can be generalized to express the value\\nof the state to some other individual.\\n.X\\n85\\t2\\t1037\\n123\\t1\\t1037\\n131\\t1\\t1037\\n137\\t1\\t1037\\n355\\t1\\t1037\\n382\\t1\\t1037\\n457\\t1\\t1037\\n634\\t1\\t1037\\n716\\t1\\t1037\\n791\\t1\\t1037\\n804\\t1\\t1037\\n965\\t1\\t1037\\n1019\\t1\\t1037\\n1037\\t6\\t1037\\n1045\\t2\\t1037\\n1187\\t1\\t1037\\n1408\\t1\\t1037\\n1408\\t1\\t1037\\n.I 1038\\n.T\\nManagement Misinformation Systems\\n.A\\nAckoff, R.L.\\n.W\\n  Five assumptions commonly made by designers of management information\\nsystems are identified.  It is argued that these are not justified in many (if \\nnot most) cases and hence lead to major deficiencies in the resulting systems.\\nThese assumptions are: (1) the critical deficiency under which most managers\\noperate is the lack of relevant information, (2) the manager needs the\\ninformation he wants, (3) if a manager has the information he needs his decision\\nmaking will improve, (4) better communication between managers improves\\norganizational performance, and (5) a manager does not have to understand\\nhow his information system works, only how to use it.

For\\nexample, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive\\nindex, in order to generate a wide range of project scores.  The additive\\nindex is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index.\\nThe most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary\\nfashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model\\nbuilders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on\\nresulting project scores.  Comparative analyses relating project rankings\\nproduced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability\\nindex and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of\\nthe scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development\\nof the model.  Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of\\nproject data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or\\ncategories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications\\nfor final project scores and associated rankings.\\n.X\\n423\\t4\\t1039\\n424\\t2\\t1039\\n425\\t4\\t1039\\n426\\t1\\t1039\\n427\\t2\\t1039\\n428\\t2\\t1039\\n436\\t1\\t1039\\n437\\t1\\t1039\\n561\\t2\\t1039\\n1039\\t6\\t1039\\n1040\\t4\\t1039\\n1449\\t1\\t1039\\n1449\\t1\\t1039\\n.I 1040\\n.T\\nA Scoring Methodology for Assessing the Suitability of Management Science\\nModels\\n.A\\nSouder, W.E.\\n.W\\n  In this study, five major criteria (realism, flexibility, capability, case\\nof use, and cost) for evaluating the suitability of management science models\\nfor R & D project selection are established, through personal interviews with\\nR&D administrators and management scientists.

This strategy is developed by devoting\\nconsiderable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and,\\nparticularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of\\nsatisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of\\nrequirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two\\nelements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any\\nprevious report in the area of job satisfaction.\\n    Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both\\nacademicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as a\\npowerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature\\nand correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area have\\nbeen plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring\\ndevices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different\\nscale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened the\\ndoor for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the\\njigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, the\\npresent volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed\\nmeasuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across\\nstudies.

It is to aid in this\\nunderstanding, as well as to describe the case at hand, that this report\\nis written.\\n.X\\n89\\t2\\t1050\\n102\\t1\\t1050\\n105\\t1\\t1050\\n109\\t1\\t1050\\n110\\t1\\t1050\\n137\\t1\\t1050\\n139\\t1\\t1050\\n147\\t1\\t1050\\n155\\t1\\t1050\\n157\\t1\\t1050\\n210\\t1\\t1050\\n312\\t1\\t1050\\n314\\t1\\t1050\\n355\\t1\\t1050\\n356\\t3\\t1050\\n391\\t3\\t1050\\n426\\t1\\t1050\\n436\\t3\\t1050\\n437\\t2\\t1050\\n544\\t1\\t1050\\n560\\t1\\t1050\\n582\\t1\\t1050\\n656\\t1\\t1050\\n658\\t2\\t1050\\n685\\t1\\t1050\\n763\\t1\\t1050\\n788\\t1\\t1050\\n986\\t1\\t1050\\n1030\\t1\\t1050\\n1050\\t7\\t1050\\n1062\\t1\\t1050\\n1254\\t1\\t1050\\n1256\\t1\\t1050\\n1284\\t1\\t1050\\n1285\\t1\\t1050\\n1288\\t2\\t1050\\n1290\\t1\\t1050\\n1291\\t2\\t1050\\n1293\\t1\\t1050\\n1294\\t1\\t1050\\n1295\\t1\\t1050\\n1296\\t2\\t1050\\n1297\\t1\\t1050\\n1319\\t1\\t1050\\n1339\\t1\\t1050\\n1346\\t1\\t1050\\n1386\\t2\\t1050\\n1404\\t1\\t1050\\n1404\\t1\\t1050\\n.I 1051\\n.T\\nMEDLARS\\n1963-1967\\n.A\\nAustin, C.J.\\n.W\\n  The purpose of this document is to present\\na final description of the system as it has\\nevolved through a period of four years of\\noperation.

In effect,\\nsince the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon\\nthe examination of one \"level of processing\" of the document (e.g., the\\ncitation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties\\nof what constitutes \"relevance\".  However, prior to such an analysis, an\\neven more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions\\nof a document should be examined.\\n  An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs),\\nfunctioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict \\nthe relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents\\nby motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled\\nexperimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate\\nresponse products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph,\\nlast paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be\\nrepresentative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and\\nabstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that:\\n    1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment\\n       groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match\\n       the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document;\\n    2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted\\n       relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs;\\n    3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and\\n    4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not\\n       substantive.\\n  Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previous\\nwork with unmotivated subjects.\\n.X\\n35\\t2\\t1054\\n42\\t1\\t1054\\n43\\t1\\t1054\\n52\\t1\\t1054\\n58\\t1\\t1054\\n70\\t1\\t1054\\n73\\t1\\t1054\\n81\\t1\\t1054\\n86\\t1\\t1054\\n95\\t1\\t1054\\n194\\t1\\t1054\\n420\\t1\\t1054\\n451\\t1\\t1054\\n480\\t1\\t1054\\n571\\t1\\t1054\\n578\\t1\\t1054\\n582\\t1\\t1054\\n589\\t1\\t1054\\n594\\t1\\t1054\\n595\\t1\\t1054\\n655\\t1\\t1054\\n656\\t1\\t1054\\n657\\t2\\t1054\\n712\\t1\\t1054\\n781\\t1\\t1054\\n785\\t1\\t1054\\n817\\t1\\t1054\\n825\\t1\\t1054\\n1024\\t1\\t1054\\n1045\\t1\\t1054\\n1054\\t5\\t1054\\n1154\\t1\\t1054\\n1215\\t1\\t1054\\n1232\\t1\\t1054\\n1281\\t1\\t1054\\n1295\\t1\\t1054\\n1298\\t1\\t1054\\n1298\\t1\\t1054\\n.I 1055\\n.T\\nThe Use of Biomedical Periodical Literature at the National Lending\\nLibrary for Science and Technology\\n.A\\nWood, D.N.\\nBower, C.A.\\n.W\\n  The paper reports the results of a two week questionnaire survey of the use\\nof biomedical periodical literature carried out at the UK National Lending \\nLibrary in February 1969.  The survey was designated to discover the subject,\\ndate and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the most\\nfrequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of references\\nto biomedical publications.\\n  The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issues\\ninvolved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand was\\nless than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests\\nwere for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biological\\nliterature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8\\nper cent) involved English language periodicals.\\n  Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literature\\nwere citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recent\\nliterature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primary\\nsources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the most\\nused indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents.\\n.X\\n2\\t1\\t1055\\n33\\t1\\t1055\\n36\\t1\\t1055\\n41\\t1\\t1055\\n65\\t1\\t1055\\n75\\t1\\t1055\\n76\\t3\\t1055\\n89\\t2\\t1055\\n97\\t1\\t1055\\n102\\t1\\t1055\\n111\\t1\\t1055\\n112\\t1\\t1055\\n132\\t1\\t1055\\n137\\t1\\t1055\\n139\\t1\\t1055\\n152\\t1\\t1055\\n155\\t1\\t1055\\n156\\t1\\t1055\\n163\\t1\\t1055\\n183\\t3\\t1055\\n184\\t2\\t1055\\n193\\t2\\t1055\\n195\\t1\\t1055\\n198\\t1\\t1055\\n199\\t1\\t1055\\n201\\t1\\t1055\\n203\\t2\\t1055\\n204\\t2\\t1055\\n210\\t3\\t1055\\n213\\t1\\t1055\\n214\\t1\\t1055\\n225\\t1\\t1055\\n269\\t1\\t1055\\n359\\t1\\t1055\\n373\\t1\\t1055\\n382\\t1\\t1055\\n475\\t1\\t1055\\n495\\t1\\t1055\\n526\\t1\\t1055\\n545\\t1\\t1055\\n552\\t3\\t1055\\n587\\t1\\t1055\\n605\\t1\\t1055\\n613\\t1\\t1055\\n614\\t1\\t1055\\n638\\t1\\t1055\\n676\\t1\\t1055\\n735\\t2\\t1055\\n747\\t1\\t1055\\n750\\t1\\t1055\\n753\\t1\\t1055\\n760\\t1\\t1055\\n766\\t2\\t1055\\n767\\t1\\t1055\\n774\\t1\\t1055\\n775\\t2\\t1055\\n779\\t1\\t1055\\n782\\t1\\t1055\\n784\\t2\\t1055\\n788\\t3\\t1055\\n789\\t2\\t1055\\n790\\t1\\t1055\\n793\\t1\\t1055\\n800\\t1\\t1055\\n808\\t1\\t1055\\n828\\t1\\t1055\\n905\\t1\\t1055\\n953\\t1\\t1055\\n977\\t2\\t1055\\n983\\t1\\t1055\\n1016\\t1\\t1055\\n1023\\t1\\t1055\\n1030\\t1\\t1055\\n1055\\t7\\t1055\\n1056\\t1\\t1055\\n1083\\t1\\t1055\\n1086\\t1\\t1055\\n1087\\t1\\t1055\\n1090\\t1\\t1055\\n1135\\t1\\t1055\\n1260\\t1\\t1055\\n1275\\t1\\t1055\\n1276\\t1\\t1055\\n1278\\t1\\t1055\\n1280\\t1\\t1055\\n1281\\t1\\t1055\\n1285\\t1\\t1055\\n1286\\t1\\t1055\\n1287\\t1\\t1055\\n1295\\t1\\t1055\\n1297\\t1\\t1055\\n1302\\t1\\t1055\\n1335\\t1\\t1055\\n1390\\t1\\t1055\\n1397\\t2\\t1055\\n1417\\t1\\t1055\\n1428\\t1\\t1055\\n1432\\t2\\t1055\\n1451\\t1\\t1055\\n1451\\t1\\t1055\\n.I 1056\\n.T\\nMetropolitan Public Library\\n.A\\nBundy, M.L.\\n.W\\n  Public libraries in the 1960\\'s which are active and alert and interested\\nin meeting the interests of their various publics face problems far\\ndifferent from those of even a decade ago.

It argues that such social variables\\nas the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or\\ndisciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain\\nphage work\\'s development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Even\\nthough persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided\\nto enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though\\nsome recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient\\nto account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the\\ncompetitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecular\\nbiology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position,\\nadduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence\\nof experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and\\nphilosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which\\noccur in scientific development.\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t1063\\n95\\t1\\t1063\\n98\\t1\\t1063\\n101\\t2\\t1063\\n102\\t1\\t1063\\n105\\t4\\t1063\\n109\\t1\\t1063\\n110\\t1\\t1063\\n343\\t1\\t1063\\n386\\t1\\t1063\\n391\\t1\\t1063\\n398\\t1\\t1063\\n544\\t2\\t1063\\n560\\t1\\t1063\\n605\\t1\\t1063\\n667\\t1\\t1063\\n750\\t1\\t1063\\n775\\t1\\t1063\\n800\\t1\\t1063\\n1030\\t2\\t1063\\n1063\\t7\\t1063\\n1081\\t1\\t1063\\n1082\\t1\\t1063\\n1088\\t1\\t1063\\n1284\\t1\\t1063\\n1285\\t1\\t1063\\n1286\\t1\\t1063\\n1287\\t1\\t1063\\n1300\\t1\\t1063\\n1308\\t1\\t1063\\n1312\\t1\\t1063\\n1315\\t1\\t1063\\n1329\\t1\\t1063\\n1334\\t1\\t1063\\n1342\\t1\\t1063\\n1386\\t2\\t1063\\n1387\\t2\\t1063\\n1389\\t1\\t1063\\n1408\\t1\\t1063\\n1408\\t1\\t1063\\n.I 1064\\n.T\\nModern Manuscripts  A Practical Manual for Their Management, Care and Use\\n.A\\nDuckett, K.W.\\n.W\\n                The title of this book is intended to indicate\\nthat its scope is limited to manuscripts of the seventeenth century\\nto the present.

Therefore the book has\\nthree foci:  organizational goals; organizational structure; and organizations\\nand their social environment.  Considerably more space is devoted to\\norganizational structure than to the other topics, for two reasons:  First,\\nmore research has been conducted and more writings are available on\\norganizational structure than on organizational goals (Chapter 2) and \\nenvironment.  Second, the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed\\ntheir interests on structural aspects of the organization, and thus, we may\\nbest evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational\\nstructure.\\n.X\\n270\\t1\\t1065\\n285\\t1\\t1065\\n301\\t1\\t1065\\n381\\t1\\t1065\\n1015\\t1\\t1065\\n1065\\t6\\t1065\\n1150\\t1\\t1065\\n1333\\t1\\t1065\\n1353\\t1\\t1065\\n1454\\t1\\t1065\\n1454\\t1\\t1065\\n.I 1066\\n.T\\nA Modern Outline of Library Classification\\n.A\\nMills, J.\\n.W\\n        This outline is based mainly on lectures given at the North-Western\\nPolytechnic to students studying for the Library Association\\'s Registration\\nExamination in Classification and Cataloguing.\\n        It is hoped that it will help to meet the need, increasingly felt in \\nrecent years by students and teachers of the subject, for a reasonably simple\\ntextbook on Library Classification which takes account of the considerable \\ndevelopments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years.  As is \\nwell known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also,\\nin more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments,\\na coherent theory of library classification has been established in each\\nof its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in\\nthe alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.  It is now possible to\\nconstruct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions\\n(of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly)\\nis considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.

It appeared that one of\\nthe major contributors to this apparent diversity of results was\\nthe unstable nature of the subjective data on which studies in\\nthis field have been typically based.\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t1070\\n128\\t1\\t1070\\n129\\t1\\t1070\\n130\\t1\\t1070\\n167\\t1\\t1070\\n173\\t1\\t1070\\n223\\t1\\t1070\\n225\\t1\\t1070\\n227\\t1\\t1070\\n234\\t1\\t1070\\n280\\t1\\t1070\\n285\\t1\\t1070\\n293\\t1\\t1070\\n296\\t1\\t1070\\n298\\t1\\t1070\\n301\\t1\\t1070\\n302\\t1\\t1070\\n393\\t1\\t1070\\n418\\t5\\t1070\\n468\\t1\\t1070\\n494\\t1\\t1070\\n639\\t1\\t1070\\n646\\t1\\t1070\\n647\\t1\\t1070\\n651\\t1\\t1070\\n765\\t1\\t1070\\n768\\t1\\t1070\\n774\\t1\\t1070\\n818\\t1\\t1070\\n822\\t1\\t1070\\n823\\t2\\t1070\\n827\\t1\\t1070\\n842\\t1\\t1070\\n843\\t1\\t1070\\n844\\t1\\t1070\\n925\\t2\\t1070\\n943\\t1\\t1070\\n944\\t1\\t1070\\n1015\\t1\\t1070\\n1069\\t3\\t1070\\n1070\\t6\\t1070\\n1085\\t1\\t1070\\n1150\\t2\\t1070\\n1186\\t1\\t1070\\n1187\\t1\\t1070\\n1214\\t2\\t1070\\n1233\\t1\\t1070\\n1374\\t1\\t1070\\n1390\\t1\\t1070\\n1401\\t1\\t1070\\n1437\\t1\\t1070\\n1454\\t1\\t1070\\n1455\\t2\\t1070\\n1455\\t2\\t1070\\n.I 1071\\n.T\\nAn Integrated Health-Science Core Library for Physicians, Nurses and Allied\\nHealth Practitioners in Community Hospitals\\n.A\\nStearns, Norman S.\\n.A\\nRatcliff, Wendy W.\\n.W\\n   This Core Medical Library has been revised, updated and expanded in the hope \\nof providing a single library facility for the entire health-care team..

Terminological aspects are not\\nprovided for, hierarchical order often is fictitious, and the representation\\nof special fields is inadequate.

The specific facets of each field should be represented by a uniform\\narray of special auxiliaries attached to the fields through the technique\\nof interrupted subdivision.  These should express the following categories:\\n(1) Theory, (2) Objects, (3) Processes, (4) Attributes, (6) Order, organization,\\n(7) Relation, (8) Determination, (9) Evaluation.

The emphasis of the study as stated by \\nCOSATI is as follows:\\n    1. Initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems \\nrelating to scientific and technical documents, their handling and the\\nmanagement of such documents.  Specific matters to be reported on will include, \\nthe current organizational and functional situation in the United States; the \\nextent to which known  deficiencies are causing a reduction in the  potential \\nfor technical effectiveness in the United States scientific and technical \\ncommunity; the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for \\ncorrection of these deficiencies; and one or more action plans which can be\\nfollowed by governmental (especially including Congress) and non-governmental \\nunits.\\n    2.

Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at \\none time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their \\nparticular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of\\nits future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to \\nscientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their\\nown right.\\n  Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread \\nwithin a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can \\ntherefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set of \\nmathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of \\nscientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to \\nestablish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area \\nof scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines\\nof investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the \\ngiven area.\\n  The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it\\nto the development of knowledge about mast cells.  In his recent comprehensive \\nsurvey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a \"full bibliography\" \\nin which \"every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.\"  This bibliography \\nconstitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of \\nscientific ideas, since it provides us with  all the contributions to the \\nsubject area, from Ehrlich\\'s discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963.

Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical\\nframework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is\\ncareful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, \\nin case the value of the aging factor a or the\\ncontents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very \\nlittle experimental evidence on the consistency\\nof either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor \\nis reasonably constant.  But the position of\\nthe Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M.\\nWeingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in \\nthe Journal of Ecology three or more times in\\n1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in \\nthe two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in\\nboth.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, \\nonly eight (25%) attained that level in both, and\\ntwelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank \\ncorrelation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.\\n  There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data\\nanalyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid\\nparameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no\\nmention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the \\nearlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which \\nanalyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in \\nterms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have\\ndiscussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations \\nto that article.  Their work implies a more complex\\nrelation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of\\ncitations for forecasting library consultations\\nremains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not\\nnecessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often \\nintended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again,\\neach citation represents an author\\'s selection from a wider group most of \\nwhich he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any\\ninherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between \\nthe list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers.\\n.X\\n14\\t1\\t1090\\n33\\t1\\t1090\\n36\\t1\\t1090\\n41\\t2\\t1090\\n89\\t1\\t1090\\n97\\t1\\t1090\\n102\\t1\\t1090\\n111\\t1\\t1090\\n112\\t1\\t1090\\n153\\t1\\t1090\\n163\\t1\\t1090\\n170\\t1\\t1090\\n183\\t1\\t1090\\n184\\t1\\t1090\\n193\\t1\\t1090\\n196\\t1\\t1090\\n199\\t1\\t1090\\n203\\t1\\t1090\\n210\\t1\\t1090\\n215\\t1\\t1090\\n219\\t1\\t1090\\n221\\t1\\t1090\\n223\\t1\\t1090\\n225\\t1\\t1090\\n255\\t1\\t1090\\n266\\t1\\t1090\\n269\\t1\\t1090\\n271\\t1\\t1090\\n359\\t3\\t1090\\n373\\t1\\t1090\\n505\\t1\\t1090\\n515\\t1\\t1090\\n545\\t1\\t1090\\n550\\t1\\t1090\\n552\\t1\\t1090\\n573\\t1\\t1090\\n587\\t1\\t1090\\n605\\t1\\t1090\\n613\\t1\\t1090\\n614\\t3\\t1090\\n616\\t1\\t1090\\n638\\t1\\t1090\\n735\\t1\\t1090\\n747\\t1\\t1090\\n748\\t1\\t1090\\n750\\t1\\t1090\\n751\\t1\\t1090\\n753\\t1\\t1090\\n759\\t1\\t1090\\n765\\t1\\t1090\\n766\\t1\\t1090\\n767\\t1\\t1090\\n775\\t1\\t1090\\n778\\t1\\t1090\\n782\\t1\\t1090\\n784\\t1\\t1090\\n788\\t1\\t1090\\n789\\t1\\t1090\\n793\\t3\\t1090\\n800\\t1\\t1090\\n808\\t2\\t1090\\n905\\t1\\t1090\\n953\\t1\\t1090\\n977\\t1\\t1090\\n983\\t1\\t1090\\n1016\\t2\\t1090\\n1019\\t1\\t1090\\n1023\\t1\\t1090\\n1028\\t1\\t1090\\n1030\\t1\\t1090\\n1055\\t1\\t1090\\n1071\\t1\\t1090\\n1083\\t1\\t1090\\n1085\\t2\\t1090\\n1086\\t2\\t1090\\n1087\\t1\\t1090\\n1090\\t7\\t1090\\n1135\\t1\\t1090\\n1147\\t1\\t1090\\n1182\\t1\\t1090\\n1260\\t1\\t1090\\n1275\\t1\\t1090\\n1276\\t1\\t1090\\n1278\\t1\\t1090\\n1280\\t1\\t1090\\n1285\\t1\\t1090\\n1286\\t1\\t1090\\n1287\\t1\\t1090\\n1302\\t3\\t1090\\n1335\\t1\\t1090\\n1352\\t1\\t1090\\n1390\\t1\\t1090\\n1397\\t1\\t1090\\n1417\\t1\\t1090\\n1424\\t1\\t1090\\n1428\\t1\\t1090\\n1432\\t1\\t1090\\n1432\\t1\\t1090\\n.I 1091\\n.T\\nEffectiveness of Combining Title Words and Index\\nTerms in Machine Retrieval Searches\\n.A\\nFisher, H.L.\\n.W\\n  Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science\\nAbstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we\\nused the generalized file-management system, Master Control,\\nwhich can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode.\\nThe inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique\\nvocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with\\nall record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For\\nexample, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one\\nentry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus\\nthe record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For\\nexample, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one\\nentry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus\\nthe record numbers in which each word was found.  (In Master\\nControl, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on\\neither side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma,\\ncolon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode the\\ndata element is compared with the profile word, character by\\ncharacter, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming\\nprocess for large data bases.\\n  We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large\\namount of data to be searched.  Individual tables were\\nconstructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and\\ntitles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlled\\nby the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.\\n  We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions had\\nto be of real interest to laboratory personnel.

I.\\n.W\\n   The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval\\nlanguage for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical\\ndocument collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general\\nand special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to\\nhigher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a\\nlexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the\\ndictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords..\\n   The indexing procedure includes:  analysis of document content and its\\ncharacterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the\\nsearch pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described\\nwhich are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that\\nconstitute the elements of the formalized model of a document\\'s condensed \\ncontent.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval \\nlanguage comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of\\nthe document..\\n   Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using\\nmathematical-statistic methods are given..\\n   Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and\\n70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been \\ncorroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to\\n2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses there\\nare the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single\\nabstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future\\ncharged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor\\nlanguage.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical\\nsensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be   \\nbased on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for\\ndocument and request indexing..\\n.X\\n68\\t1\\t1124\\n77\\t1\\t1124\\n78\\t1\\t1124\\n79\\t1\\t1124\\n420\\t1\\t1124\\n458\\t1\\t1124\\n595\\t1\\t1124\\n712\\t1\\t1124\\n790\\t1\\t1124\\n1118\\t3\\t1124\\n1124\\t5\\t1124\\n1131\\t1\\t1124\\n1165\\t2\\t1124\\n1167\\t1\\t1124\\n1382\\t1\\t1124\\n1382\\t1\\t1124\\n.I 1125\\n.T\\nA Contribution to the Theory of the Systems of Information Flows\\n.A\\nKozachkov, L.

Central to the\\nstudy rationale was the notion that librarianship should be viewed not as\\na static institution committed solely to traditional objectives, but as one\\nwith the capacity to be responsive to changing environmental requirements.\\nIt was hoped that from the intelligence gathered from these inquiries\\ncertain of the significant dimensions of the field\\'s manpower concerns\\nwould be illuminated and proposals to influence future development\\nwould be drawn.

One question was: \"Have you, during your current research,\\ndiscovered in the literature information which you wish you had had at the \\nbeginning of your project?\"  To this, 144 of them (22 per cent) replied that\\nthey had.  Many had made more than one such find, so that the total number of \\ninstances was 245.\\n.X\\n2\\t1\\t1151\\n32\\t1\\t1151\\n33\\t1\\t1151\\n36\\t1\\t1151\\n40\\t1\\t1151\\n83\\t1\\t1151\\n90\\t1\\t1151\\n147\\t1\\t1151\\n150\\t1\\t1151\\n161\\t1\\t1151\\n183\\t1\\t1151\\n184\\t1\\t1151\\n193\\t1\\t1151\\n199\\t1\\t1151\\n201\\t1\\t1151\\n202\\t1\\t1151\\n203\\t1\\t1151\\n204\\t1\\t1151\\n205\\t1\\t1151\\n209\\t1\\t1151\\n212\\t1\\t1151\\n217\\t1\\t1151\\n220\\t1\\t1151\\n222\\t1\\t1151\\n284\\t1\\t1151\\n286\\t1\\t1151\\n294\\t1\\t1151\\n369\\t1\\t1151\\n382\\t1\\t1151\\n465\\t1\\t1151\\n543\\t1\\t1151\\n588\\t1\\t1151\\n613\\t1\\t1151\\n624\\t1\\t1151\\n717\\t1\\t1151\\n771\\t1\\t1151\\n782\\t1\\t1151\\n799\\t1\\t1151\\n800\\t1\\t1151\\n808\\t1\\t1151\\n959\\t1\\t1151\\n1068\\t1\\t1151\\n1089\\t1\\t1151\\n1151\\t9\\t1151\\n1361\\t1\\t1151\\n1361\\t1\\t1151\\n.I 1152\\n.T\\nNon-book Materials: The Organization of Integrated Collections\\n.A\\nWeihs, J.R.\\n.B\\n1970\\n.W\\n  This book presupposes a knowledge of book cataloguing and basic cataloguing\\nprinciples.

The schedule of reports and each \\nof their sections proceed from the need for maximum \"noise-resistance\" of\\nreports as used by various categories of users and giving an exhaustive \\ndescription of final and intermediate R&D results.. The author shows that the\\ndifference between the notion of \"information value\" and of \"document value\"\\ndictates a specific approach to organization of the flows of documentary\\ninformation, duplication of data in documents of various kind, and to \\ndevelopment of the logical format and literary style of scientific documents..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t1174\\n789\\t1\\t1174\\n808\\t1\\t1174\\n1097\\t2\\t1174\\n1109\\t1\\t1174\\n1111\\t1\\t1174\\n1122\\t1\\t1174\\n1123\\t1\\t1174\\n1125\\t1\\t1174\\n1160\\t1\\t1174\\n1172\\t1\\t1174\\n1174\\t5\\t1174\\n1176\\t1\\t1174\\n1285\\t1\\t1174\\n1285\\t1\\t1174\\n.I 1175\\n.T\\nSyntagmatic Relations Between Descriptors\\n.A\\nChernyi, A.I.\\n.W\\n   Syntagmatic relations (SR) are defined as connections between words that are\\nestablished aposteriori and combine these words into phrases and sentences..\\nThe lack of means for recording SR in descriptor languages results in a \\nreduction of retrieval precision.. At present, roles and links and the \\nevaluation of the extent to which these devices are used are the major devices\\nused for the description of SR between descriptors in documents\\' search \\npatterns.. An analysis of published results of experiments testing the \\nperformance of roles and links in 176 descriptor retrieval systems operative in\\nthe USA suggests the conclusion about a poor performance of roles as a \\nprecision device:  an increase of 10 percent in precision with the aid of roles\\nis accompanied by a 10 percent reduction of recall.. Links provide for \\napproximately the same increase of precision.. The author states the general\\nrequirements to a simple and flexible grammar for descriptor languages, and\\nshow that the approach the suggest ts has been partially implemented in the\\ninformation retrieval language for radioelectronics and computer technology\\ndeveloped at the Institute of Cybernetics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences\\nin Kiev, and in the SYNTOL (France)..\\n.X\\n29\\t1\\t1175\\n68\\t1\\t1175\\n69\\t1\\t1175\\n119\\t1\\t1175\\n151\\t1\\t1175\\n175\\t1\\t1175\\n261\\t1\\t1175\\n346\\t1\\t1175\\n382\\t1\\t1175\\n388\\t1\\t1175\\n458\\t2\\t1175\\n476\\t1\\t1175\\n477\\t1\\t1175\\n478\\t1\\t1175\\n479\\t1\\t1175\\n480\\t1\\t1175\\n484\\t1\\t1175\\n485\\t1\\t1175\\n566\\t1\\t1175\\n680\\t1\\t1175\\n704\\t1\\t1175\\n761\\t1\\t1175\\n781\\t1\\t1175\\n798\\t1\\t1175\\n1118\\t2\\t1175\\n1163\\t1\\t1175\\n1175\\t5\\t1175\\n1175\\t5\\t1175\\n.I 1176\\n.T\\nTechinical Bibliographies in Metallurgy\\n.A\\nGedrimovich, G.

It is\\neasier, and probably more useful, to give examples of formal organizations\\nthan to define the term.  The United States Steel Corporation is a formal\\norganization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New York\\nState Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part of\\na larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposes\\nwe need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn\\naround an organization or the exact distinction between an \"organization\" and\\na \"nonorganization.\"  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the world\\nhas an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean\\nclassifications.\\n    Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which\\nthey are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged.\\nWe cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However much\\norganizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and\\nadministrators, and however many books for these practitioners have \\nbeen written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant\\nplace in modern social science.  Most current psychology and\\nsociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the\\nsubject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology\\n(Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, \"industrial\\nsocial psychology\" (with only passing references to organizations),\\nleadership, and voting behavior.

A.\\n.W\\n   It is pointed out that communication processes can be represented as \\nepidemic processes.. Consequently, epidemic theory can be applied to the\\nstudy of any process in which information is transmitted within a population.. \\nThe members of such populations need not be human beings but could be\\nmicro-organisms or even machines.. The fundamental notion of stability of an\\nepidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived.. A \\nmechanism, called an information retrieval process, which instigates an epidemic\\nprocess is defined, certain general properties of the mechanism are established \\nand the means of controlling it are discussed.. Pontryagin\\'s maximum principle\\nis applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process \\nand it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the\\nsense of Lyapunov..

Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to be\\ndone than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies\\nthat could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly\\nexpressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed\\nutilization of existing manpower.\\n  It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then\\npresident of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee\\non Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments\\nand to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing\\nprofessional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few\\nlibraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers\\nthat they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a\\nneed was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could\\nbe more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might\\nhave national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be\\nsought.\\n.X\\n234\\t1\\t1206\\n304\\t1\\t1206\\n306\\t1\\t1206\\n338\\t1\\t1206\\n646\\t1\\t1206\\n647\\t1\\t1206\\n651\\t1\\t1206\\n942\\t1\\t1206\\n943\\t1\\t1206\\n944\\t1\\t1206\\n948\\t1\\t1206\\n1017\\t1\\t1206\\n1049\\t1\\t1206\\n1206\\t6\\t1206\\n1237\\t1\\t1206\\n1378\\t1\\t1206\\n1440\\t1\\t1206\\n1450\\t1\\t1206\\n1453\\t1\\t1206\\n1453\\t1\\t1206\\n.I 1207\\n.T\\nTechnical Information Project\\n.A\\nKessler, M.

These are: the effects of automation\\nand electronics on planning; the overall organization of service\\npatterns; and, the relevance of other audiovisual learning media.\\n  This is a book about the planning process, not the details\\nof all parts of a building.  It will not tell you which floor\\ncovering is best, which light fixtures to use or which kind of\\nlibrary shelving to buy.  These matters are treated in detail\\nby Metcalf.  It will, however, try to tell you how to go\\nabout solving these and the many other problems planners face.\\n  Wherever it seems relevant and proper, I have included \\nsketches to illustrate the point under discussion.

In order to discover how to get the Image into\\nmotion, therefore, we reviewed once more the cybernetic literature\\non the analogies between brains and computers, between minds and\\nprograms.\\n    Our fundamental concern, however, was to discover whether\\nthe cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology.  The men\\nwho have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent\\nabout psychology - the creatures whose behavior they want to\\nsimulate often seem more like a mathematician\\'s dream than like\\nliving animals.  But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to \\nbelieve that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or \\neven an advantage.  There must be some way to phrase the new ideas so \\nthat they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior \\nthat psychologists have created.

Twenty years later, with chain\\nprocedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered\\na new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first\\nissues of 1971.\\n  To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider\\nthese indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling\\nbibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two\\nforces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject\\nindexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; \\nsecondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange\\nnetworks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.\\n  In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of\\nsubject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be\\ndominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified\\nby the indexer, would be offered as the user\\'s access point to the alphabetical\\nfile.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal\\nof Cutter\\'s \"Rules for a dictionary catalog\" is devoted to the problem of \\nidentifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting\\nit as the user\\'s access point, even when this entailed a distortion of\\nnatural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselected\\ncomponent would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also\\ncreated a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings\\nwould be co-extensive with the subject of the document.\\n.X\\n86\\t1\\t1215\\n146\\t1\\t1215\\n160\\t1\\t1215\\n168\\t2\\t1215\\n194\\t1\\t1215\\n258\\t1\\t1215\\n259\\t1\\t1215\\n434\\t1\\t1215\\n445\\t1\\t1215\\n449\\t1\\t1215\\n458\\t1\\t1215\\n478\\t3\\t1215\\n480\\t4\\t1215\\n487\\t1\\t1215\\n530\\t1\\t1215\\n746\\t2\\t1215\\n758\\t1\\t1215\\n781\\t1\\t1215\\n817\\t2\\t1215\\n819\\t1\\t1215\\n824\\t1\\t1215\\n825\\t7\\t1215\\n874\\t1\\t1215\\n880\\t1\\t1215\\n901\\t1\\t1215\\n1024\\t5\\t1215\\n1027\\t1\\t1215\\n1054\\t1\\t1215\\n1061\\t1\\t1215\\n1146\\t1\\t1215\\n1215\\t19\\t1215\\n1230\\t2\\t1215\\n1231\\t1\\t1215\\n1255\\t1\\t1215\\n1265\\t1\\t1215\\n1441\\t1\\t1215\\n1443\\t1\\t1215\\n1448\\t1\\t1215\\n1448\\t1\\t1215\\n.I 1216\\n.T\\nPrejudices and Antipathies:\\nA tract on the LC subject heads concerning people\\n.A\\nBerman, S.\\n.W\\n        Since the first edition of Library of Congress subject\\nheadings appeared 60 years ago, American and other libraries\\nhave increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority --\\nif not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There can\\nbe no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a\\nlabor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its\\nvalue as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving\\nsome uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic.\\nUndoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to\\nordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings\\nin subject catalogs as far removed geographically as\\nWashington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarship\\nare, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally,\\nmanage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and\\nsubsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the\\nworldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realm\\nof headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with\\nhumanity--the LC list can only \"satisfy\" parochial, jingoistic\\nEuropeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally\\nChristian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably\\nsituated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely\\ndomiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established\\nOrder, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of \\nWestern civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed, \\nobsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to young\\npeople and women.

G. R.\\nFrench, Thomas\\n.W\\n   At Birmingham University Library it is proposed to implement in October \\nl972, a complete microfilm catalogue system.. This system originated from two \\nsources.. Over the past two years various means have been evaluated of\\nconverting the library\\'s card catalogues (which were closed at the end of 1971)\\nto a more compact form.. An interim report mentioned microfilming as one of a \\nnumber of possibilities.. At the time the production of hard copy was \\nenvisaged, but since then a true microform system has seemed preferable, in \\nwhich the catalogue would exist as cassettes of film to be viewed by all users\\non reader machines.. This system has been specified and costed, and details are\\nincluded in this paper.. The impetus in reaching this viewpoint was provided by\\nthe progress made over the last 18 months in the field of COM, which rapidly\\ncommended itself as the choice of output medium for the new mechanized \\nMARC-based catalogue, which covers all the library\\'s serials and all \\nmonographs acquired after January 1972.. BLCMP union catalogues in these\\ncategories will also be held in COM form at Birmingham University Library..\\n.X\\n56\\t2\\t1229\\n90\\t1\\t1229\\n289\\t1\\t1229\\n294\\t1\\t1229\\n553\\t1\\t1229\\n612\\t1\\t1229\\n617\\t1\\t1229\\n620\\t1\\t1229\\n886\\t1\\t1229\\n892\\t2\\t1229\\n963\\t1\\t1229\\n990\\t1\\t1229\\n1221\\t1\\t1229\\n1229\\t5\\t1229\\n1371\\t1\\t1229\\n1371\\t1\\t1229\\n.I 1230\\n.T\\nBook Selection from MARC Tapes: a Feasibility Study\\n.A\\nWainwright, Jane\\nHills, Jacqueline\\n.W\\n   The technical and economic feasibility of providing selective notifications\\nof current books to specialized libraries by extraction from MARC tapes has \\nbeen explored..

The programs allowed both weighted and Boolean searching on the title  \\nand author, LC classification and subject headings, and the BNB Precis indexing\\nterms and Reference Index Numbers.. Test profiles were constructed for nine\\nlibraries covering a range of subject fields, and run on six weeks of BNB and \\nsix weeks of LC MARC tapes.. The output was assessed for relevance and recall,\\nand the results analyzed in terms of precision and recall for various \\ncombinations of searchable fields.. The best performance, with recall and\\nprecision both about 50%, was given by searching all verbal fields together - \\ntitle and author, LC subject headings, and (BNB tapes only) Precis indexing \\nterms..

In this book, the definition\\nof a cooperative system is as follows:  A cooperative library system\\nis the combining of the talents and the resources of a group of\\nindependent libraries, within a reasonable geographic radius, for\\nthe purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources for\\nthe benefit of the actual and potential users of all the member\\nlibraries.  The plan for the book originated with questions directed\\nto a public library administrator and to a system director.  The\\nmost pertinent of the repeated questions was, \"How does system\\nmembership change local library administration?\"  The sharpest\\nquestion was, \"Will the system ultimately take over local rights and\\nresponsibilities?\" \\n.X\\n311\\t1\\t1236\\n340\\t1\\t1236\\n431\\t1\\t1236\\n842\\t1\\t1236\\n910\\t1\\t1236\\n939\\t1\\t1236\\n1232\\t1\\t1236\\n1236\\t6\\t1236\\n1238\\t1\\t1236\\n1400\\t1\\t1236\\n1400\\t1\\t1236\\n.I 1237\\n.T\\nPublic Libraries as Culture and Social Centers:\\nthe origin of the concept\\n.A\\nDavies, D.W.\\n.W\\n        This book is an attempt to trace the origins of non-\\nbook activities in public libraries, by which is meant the\\narrangement of fiestas, festivals, and exhibitions; the\\nconduct of classes, contests, lectures, and excursions; the\\nstaging of plays, the exhibition of movies, the demonstration\\nof karate and judo, and all similar activities not primarily\\nconcerned with books now carried on by public libraries.\\nSince ideas about libraries, as well as librarians, have\\npassed back and forth across the Atlantic with great facility,\\nin this attempt to discover origins it seems wise to follow,\\nhowever sketchily, developments in both America and Britain,\\nand to note with some care what was happening in scholarly\\nlibraries, in popular libraries for the middle classes, and\\nin libraries intended for the working classes.\\n.X\\n234\\t1\\t1237\\n304\\t1\\t1237\\n306\\t1\\t1237\\n338\\t1\\t1237\\n646\\t1\\t1237\\n647\\t1\\t1237\\n651\\t1\\t1237\\n942\\t1\\t1237\\n943\\t1\\t1237\\n944\\t1\\t1237\\n948\\t1\\t1237\\n1017\\t1\\t1237\\n1049\\t1\\t1237\\n1206\\t1\\t1237\\n1237\\t5\\t1237\\n1378\\t1\\t1237\\n1440\\t1\\t1237\\n1450\\t1\\t1237\\n1453\\t1\\t1237\\n1453\\t1\\t1237\\n.I 1238\\n.T\\nPublic Library and City\\n.A\\nConant, R.W.\\n.W\\n  This volume is an edited collection of some papers from the 1963\\nSymposium on Library Functions in the Changing Metropolis\\nsponsored by the Joint Center for Urban Studies and the National \\nBook Committee.

All too many\\nlibrarians regard government documents and in particular, the documents of\\ninternational agencies as esoteric, unlike the usual library materials in\\nformat and publication pattern, and as presenting problems of acquisitions,\\ncontrol and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left to\\nthe specialist in documents.  The result is that international documents are\\na puzzlement to the general librarian, and a source of frustration to the\\nill informed administrator; a situation exacerbated by the present general\\ntendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international\\ndocuments except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of\\na general course in government documents to which relatively few students\\nare exposed.  The information in this volume will allay the fears of the\\ngeneralist librarian.

This is not a book, to state the \\nproposition in the negative, for those who wish to read on the theoretical\\naspects of computers.\\n  The selections are brought together in seven sections.  The first, the\\nChallenge, includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age\\nof the computer.\\n  The second section, Varieties of Response, does not by any means exhaust\\ndevelopments in American libraries.  It does, I believe, contain representative\\ndescriptions of some of the best work being accomplished.\\n  The third section, Theory of Management, contains an outstanding article by\\nRichard DeGennaro of Harvard.  The particular contributions made in this \\narticle are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this\\nthird section.\\n  News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of\\nselection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety\\nof services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer.\\nThe considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the\\nfirst selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific\\nservices now being offered, or services in the planning stage.\\n  The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a\\nsubject that has elicited considerable discussion.  The two articles selected\\nare on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative\\ncosts.\\n  The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of\\nview.  The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably \\nrepresented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional\\nreadings.\\n  The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has\\nexcited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject\\nindexing could in time prove considerable.\\n.X\\n177\\t1\\t1248\\n235\\t1\\t1248\\n289\\t1\\t1248\\n291\\t1\\t1248\\n374\\t1\\t1248\\n408\\t1\\t1248\\n458\\t1\\t1248\\n471\\t1\\t1248\\n548\\t1\\t1248\\n594\\t1\\t1248\\n597\\t1\\t1248\\n598\\t1\\t1248\\n601\\t1\\t1248\\n836\\t1\\t1248\\n863\\t1\\t1248\\n864\\t1\\t1248\\n865\\t1\\t1248\\n866\\t1\\t1248\\n868\\t1\\t1248\\n897\\t1\\t1248\\n916\\t1\\t1248\\n936\\t1\\t1248\\n1052\\t1\\t1248\\n1248\\t7\\t1248\\n1327\\t1\\t1248\\n1327\\t1\\t1248\\n.I 1249\\n.T\\nReader in Medical Librarianship\\n.A\\nSewell, W.\\n.W\\n  Each kind of librarianship partakes of the general elements of librarianship,\\nand each has a flavor all its own.  This book is intended to present the flavor\\nand philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice.  If it gives\\na new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in health\\nscience organizations, so much the better.\\n  If it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation, it is\\nso no longer.  One must conceive of them as part of a medical system, and\\nindeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine\\nas practiced by a single physician for a single patient.  It extends into\\nthe health sciences as represented by dentists, pharmacists, nurses,\\nveterinarians, medical technologists, medical associates and dozens of\\nothers, some not yet possessing a clear identity.  It includes research,\\neducation and practice.  In addition to the clinical sciences, the system\\ninvolves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health.\\nIncreasingly, socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstream\\nof medicine.\\n.X\\n241\\t1\\t1249\\n1249\\t6\\t1249\\n1249\\t6\\t1249\\n.I 1250\\n.T\\nReader in Research Methods for Librarianship\\n.A\\nBundy, M.L.\\n.W\\n  The fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to \\ngenuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship to\\nthe goals of librarianship.  Viewed in this way, and perhaps as\\nantidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical\\nmatters of research, the editors\\' concern here has been less with the\\nrituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual\\ninquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the\\nhabits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and\\nthe scholar.\\n  Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which\\nclearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically\\nnot only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys\\nwhich derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit\\nfor the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more\\nto its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative\\ncapacity, who have not before held this perspective of research.\\n.X\\n616\\t1\\t1250\\n789\\t1\\t1250\\n795\\t1\\t1250\\n1242\\t1\\t1250\\n1250\\t7\\t1250\\n1403\\t1\\t1250\\n1422\\t1\\t1250\\n1428\\t1\\t1250\\n1428\\t1\\t1250\\n.I 1251\\n.T\\nReader in Technical Services\\n.A\\nApplebaum, E.

F.\\n.W\\n   This report describes the results of a study of a practical method of \\npreparing Library of Congress card catalog data in machine form for (1)\\nthe automatic typesetting of cards and book catalogs, and (2) distribution to \\nother libraries throughout the country for all foreseeable bibliographic and\\ntypographic applications of such data, including preparation of local \\ncatalogs..\\n   The first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a\\nperforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the\\ncard.. After the data is edited and corrected, it is processed by a computer\\nto form (1) catalog card typesetting tapes, (2) the National Union Catalog,\\n(3) Library of Congress Books, Subjects Catalog, magnetic tape catalog files,\\nand a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution..\\nThe procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on\\nLibrary of Congress cards, should studies find that the value of the data\\nexceeds the cost of recording it..\\n   A demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce \\nperforated tape records.. These record tapes were automatically converted to a\\nvariety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and book\\ncatalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards..\\n.X\\n159\\t1\\t1252\\n178\\t2\\t1252\\n200\\t1\\t1252\\n249\\t1\\t1252\\n852\\t1\\t1252\\n854\\t1\\t1252\\n857\\t1\\t1252\\n858\\t1\\t1252\\n859\\t1\\t1252\\n861\\t1\\t1252\\n970\\t1\\t1252\\n978\\t1\\t1252\\n997\\t1\\t1252\\n1012\\t1\\t1252\\n1042\\t1\\t1252\\n1043\\t3\\t1252\\n1071\\t1\\t1252\\n1252\\t5\\t1252\\n1371\\t1\\t1252\\n1371\\t1\\t1252\\n.I 1253\\n.T\\nRelegation and Stock Control in Libraries\\n.A\\nUrquhart, J.A.\\n.W\\n    Stock control has been defined by Buckland as \"the managerial\\nproblem of organising the physical availability of books in relation\\nto readers\".  While it has long been recognised that only a proportion\\nof the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library \\nbuildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with\\nremarkable speed.  In certain cases some new buildings are full even\\nbefore they have left the design-board stage.  It is difficult to avoid\\nthe conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that \\'in terms of long\\nrange perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is no\\nfeasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous\\nprogramme of \"selective book retirement\"\\'.  Library stock control\\nhas not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy,\\ntime and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems\\nof acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services \\nfor readers.  Early investigations of this issue have tended to be\\ntheoretical and Carol Seymour in her review \"Weeding the Collection\"\\nput forward the view that \"a librarian should be able to begin his plan\\nfor weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary...\\nHe also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at\\nhand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden\".  The Pebul Report\\nsummarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when it\\nobserved that \"weeding the bookstock\" in academic libraries was the\\n\"ungrasped nettle.\"\\n.X\\n766\\t1\\t1253\\n818\\t1\\t1253\\n843\\t1\\t1253\\n845\\t1\\t1253\\n961\\t1\\t1253\\n1020\\t1\\t1253\\n1253\\t6\\t1253\\n1401\\t1\\t1253\\n1401\\t1\\t1253\\n.I 1254\\n.T\\nReport of an Investigation on Literature Searching by Research Scientists\\n.A\\nMartin, J.\\n.W\\n   This is a factual report of the investigation..

The major portion of the two years spent on\\nthis present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerable\\namount of data which was obtained from the main test programme.  A difficulty\\nin this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely\\nto yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonable\\nlimits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, and\\neven so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has been\\nplaced on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this is\\nconsidered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has\\nnot, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance,\\nbut certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval of\\nnon-relevant references.

J.\\nEast, H.\\nSlater, M. J.\\n.W\\n   An examination is made of the current problems of the communication\\nand dissemination of literature in the field of physics.. The growth of\\nthe literature is considered quantitatively with respect to the form, subject \\nand origin of published material.. This is related to the general growth in \\nscientific activity as exemplified by increases in numbers of physicists and of\\nexpenditure on research.. The results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the\\nneeds or demands of users of the physics literature are considered, \\nparticularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of\\ninformation transfer, and the reactions of users to new services intended to\\nremedy the deficiencies..

These desiderata could\\nof course be present on the \"idea plane\" alone; but\\nwithout their being present notationally they do not\\nfurnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the type\\nof assistance it requires for optimal functioning.\\n  The second (minor) premise ought to be that the\\nUniversal Decimal Classification, being both\\nhierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desired\\nstructurality.

Kuhn.  Kuhn has not been accepted without criticism, but that need not\\nprevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion.  I assume\\nthat the reader will be familiar with Kuhn\\'s analysis,so that only a sketchy\\nsummary of his position is necessary.  I will then take a brief look at some of\\nthe history of psychology, with special emphasis upon the major tenets of\\nbehaviorism.  Finally, I will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well\\nbe living in an era of revolution within psychology (as well as without).\\n.X\\n101\\t1\\t1271\\n343\\t3\\t1271\\n1271\\t6\\t1271\\n1272\\t4\\t1271\\n1310\\t1\\t1271\\n1311\\t5\\t1271\\n1329\\t1\\t1271\\n1386\\t3\\t1271\\n1386\\t3\\t1271\\n.I 1272\\n.T\\nIs a Kuhnian Analysis Applicable to Psychology?\\n.A\\nBriskman, L.B.\\n.W\\n  As my title might suggest, I wish to discuss some aspects of Palermo\\'s recent\\npaper.  The thesis which Palermo advocated is that Kuhn\\'s view of scientific\\nrevolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology, and\\nthat, in particular, experimental psychology has had two paradigms already,\\nwith the appropriate scientific revolution between them, and that the current\\nbehavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of Kuhnian crisis.  The\\npresent note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo\\'s \\nassertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a\\nstandard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first,\\nchallenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a\\nKuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo\\'s thesis that behaviorism\\nis in a \\'crisis-state\\' but advances an alternative account of the reasons for\\nthis.\\n.X\\n343\\t2\\t1272\\n1271\\t4\\t1272\\n1272\\t5\\t1272\\n1310\\t1\\t1272\\n1311\\t4\\t1272\\n1329\\t1\\t1272\\n1386\\t2\\t1272\\n1386\\t2\\t1272\\n.I 1273\\n.T\\nBibliographical Statistics as a Guide to Growth Points in Science\\n.A\\nMeadows, A.J.\\nO\\'connor, J.G.\\n.W\\n  Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of\\nscientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about\\ntrends in science.  For example, there has been a continuing interest in the\\nquestion of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its\\nage.  These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the major\\nbranches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interested\\nin identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future.\\nAlthough such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to push\\nthese analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject\\ndivision, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical\\nproperties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect of\\nsuch work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline.\\nWe can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a \\nstatistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the \\nappearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its first\\nappearance can such an area be identified?\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t1273\\n39\\t1\\t1273\\n48\\t1\\t1273\\n89\\t1\\t1273\\n102\\t1\\t1273\\n106\\t1\\t1273\\n107\\t1\\t1273\\n111\\t1\\t1273\\n113\\t3\\t1273\\n155\\t1\\t1273\\n314\\t1\\t1273\\n605\\t1\\t1273\\n632\\t2\\t1273\\n784\\t1\\t1273\\n1087\\t1\\t1273\\n1234\\t1\\t1273\\n1270\\t1\\t1273\\n1273\\t7\\t1273\\n1274\\t3\\t1273\\n1285\\t2\\t1273\\n1287\\t1\\t1273\\n1300\\t1\\t1273\\n1301\\t1\\t1273\\n1302\\t1\\t1273\\n1304\\t2\\t1273\\n1312\\t1\\t1273\\n1313\\t3\\t1273\\n1337\\t2\\t1273\\n1338\\t2\\t1273\\n1341\\t1\\t1273\\n1342\\t1\\t1273\\n1344\\t1\\t1273\\n1346\\t1\\t1273\\n1347\\t1\\t1273\\n1387\\t1\\t1273\\n1444\\t3\\t1273\\n1444\\t3\\t1273\\n.I 1274\\n.T\\nThe Structure of Scientific Literatures \\nII: Toward a Macro- and Microstructure for Science\\n.A\\nGriffith, B.C.\\nSmall, H.G.\\nStonehill, J.A.\\nDey, S.\\n.W\\n  Part I of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientific\\nliterature, using a new technique - co-citation - to measure the degree of\\nsimilarity among documents.  The work developed directly from an earlier\\npaper which defined this measure, and explored its relationship to other\\ncitation measures for identifying relationships among documents.  We now\\nreport the outcome of an attempt to create \\'maps\\' of the scientific literature.\\nThe scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they\\npresent, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but\\nalso a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we have\\nsystematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation,\\nand have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects\\nof the specialty structure of science. \\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t1274\\n37\\t1\\t1274\\n39\\t1\\t1274\\n40\\t1\\t1274\\n41\\t1\\t1274\\n47\\t2\\t1274\\n62\\t1\\t1274\\n88\\t1\\t1274\\n97\\t1\\t1274\\n102\\t3\\t1274\\n103\\t1\\t1274\\n104\\t1\\t1274\\n106\\t2\\t1274\\n108\\t1\\t1274\\n113\\t2\\t1274\\n228\\t1\\t1274\\n229\\t1\\t1274\\n233\\t1\\t1274\\n253\\t1\\t1274\\n310\\t1\\t1274\\n313\\t1\\t1274\\n314\\t1\\t1274\\n318\\t1\\t1274\\n359\\t1\\t1274\\n363\\t1\\t1274\\n377\\t3\\t1274\\n379\\t1\\t1274\\n395\\t1\\t1274\\n409\\t1\\t1274\\n462\\t1\\t1274\\n469\\t1\\t1274\\n503\\t1\\t1274\\n505\\t1\\t1274\\n560\\t1\\t1274\\n573\\t1\\t1274\\n604\\t1\\t1274\\n605\\t1\\t1274\\n618\\t1\\t1274\\n632\\t6\\t1274\\n635\\t1\\t1274\\n667\\t1\\t1274\\n737\\t1\\t1274\\n748\\t1\\t1274\\n749\\t1\\t1274\\n751\\t1\\t1274\\n764\\t2\\t1274\\n765\\t2\\t1274\\n777\\t1\\t1274\\n778\\t2\\t1274\\n782\\t1\\t1274\\n804\\t1\\t1274\\n805\\t1\\t1274\\n853\\t1\\t1274\\n875\\t1\\t1274\\n883\\t1\\t1274\\n893\\t1\\t1274\\n952\\t1\\t1274\\n1016\\t2\\t1274\\n1061\\t1\\t1274\\n1084\\t1\\t1274\\n1085\\t1\\t1274\\n1086\\t1\\t1274\\n1087\\t1\\t1274\\n1182\\t1\\t1274\\n1200\\t1\\t1274\\n1201\\t1\\t1274\\n1234\\t3\\t1274\\n1273\\t3\\t1274\\n1274\\t13\\t1274\\n1277\\t2\\t1274\\n1278\\t2\\t1274\\n1280\\t2\\t1274\\n1285\\t5\\t1274\\n1287\\t1\\t1274\\n1291\\t1\\t1274\\n1300\\t1\\t1274\\n1301\\t2\\t1274\\n1302\\t2\\t1274\\n1304\\t3\\t1274\\n1312\\t1\\t1274\\n1313\\t11\\t1274\\n1337\\t1\\t1274\\n1338\\t2\\t1274\\n1341\\t1\\t1274\\n1342\\t1\\t1274\\n1344\\t2\\t1274\\n1347\\t1\\t1274\\n1380\\t1\\t1274\\n1386\\t1\\t1274\\n1387\\t1\\t1274\\n1419\\t1\\t1274\\n1428\\t1\\t1274\\n1444\\t4\\t1274\\n1444\\t4\\t1274\\n.I 1275\\n.T\\nCollege Libraries and Chemical Education\\n.A\\nGross, P.L.K.\\n.W\\n  The small college has stood staunch in its desire to\\nsupply the liberal education and perhaps it has done\\nwell in maintaining this position.  On the other hand,\\nmany of the large universities have shifted the\\nemphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study.\\nStill others have tried to develop both side by side.\\nFew of the small colleges have kept astride with the\\ninevitable consequences of such a situation.  The\\nfew who have are sending an increasing number of\\ntheir graduates to these universities to complete their\\ntraining.  As an example of this, it is the boast of\\nPomona College that over seventy per cent of her\\ngraduates have taken subsequent professional training.\\nIt has become the evident duty, therefore, of the\\nsmall college to prepare its men, not only to enter\\nsuch graduate schools, but also to meet successfully\\nthe ever-increasing intensity of competition found\\nthere.  This in addition to supplying a broad\\ncultural education.  This duty has brought with it\\na number of problems of first magnitude.  One of the\\nbiggest of these is the problem of adequate library\\nfacilities.\\n  It is the purpose of this paper to discuss this\\nproblem with special reference to the student whose\\ncollege major is chemistry.\\n.X\\n14\\t1\\t1275\\n33\\t2\\t1275\\n36\\t2\\t1275\\n37\\t2\\t1275\\n40\\t1\\t1275\\n41\\t2\\t1275\\n48\\t1\\t1275\\n89\\t2\\t1275\\n97\\t4\\t1275\\n102\\t1\\t1275\\n111\\t2\\t1275\\n112\\t1\\t1275\\n132\\t1\\t1275\\n137\\t1\\t1275\\n163\\t1\\t1275\\n167\\t1\\t1275\\n183\\t1\\t1275\\n184\\t1\\t1275\\n185\\t1\\t1275\\n189\\t1\\t1275\\n193\\t2\\t1275\\n195\\t2\\t1275\\n196\\t2\\t1275\\n198\\t5\\t1275\\n199\\t2\\t1275\\n201\\t2\\t1275\\n203\\t2\\t1275\\n210\\t1\\t1275\\n211\\t1\\t1275\\n217\\t1\\t1275\\n219\\t1\\t1275\\n220\\t1\\t1275\\n221\\t1\\t1275\\n225\\t1\\t1275\\n233\\t1\\t1275\\n237\\t1\\t1275\\n253\\t1\\t1275\\n255\\t1\\t1275\\n269\\t1\\t1275\\n272\\t1\\t1275\\n359\\t1\\t1275\\n361\\t2\\t1275\\n373\\t1\\t1275\\n379\\t2\\t1275\\n415\\t1\\t1275\\n543\\t1\\t1275\\n545\\t2\\t1275\\n552\\t1\\t1275\\n587\\t1\\t1275\\n588\\t1\\t1275\\n605\\t1\\t1275\\n613\\t1\\t1275\\n614\\t4\\t1275\\n616\\t2\\t1275\\n618\\t4\\t1275\\n622\\t1\\t1275\\n632\\t2\\t1275\\n635\\t4\\t1275\\n638\\t4\\t1275\\n685\\t1\\t1275\\n735\\t4\\t1275\\n747\\t1\\t1275\\n748\\t2\\t1275\\n750\\t1\\t1275\\n753\\t2\\t1275\\n756\\t1\\t1275\\n757\\t1\\t1275\\n759\\t1\\t1275\\n766\\t1\\t1275\\n767\\t3\\t1275\\n772\\t1\\t1275\\n775\\t4\\t1275\\n776\\t1\\t1275\\n777\\t1\\t1275\\n782\\t1\\t1275\\n784\\t2\\t1275\\n787\\t1\\t1275\\n788\\t2\\t1275\\n789\\t3\\t1275\\n792\\t1\\t1275\\n793\\t1\\t1275\\n800\\t1\\t1275\\n808\\t1\\t1275\\n821\\t3\\t1275\\n831\\t1\\t1275\\n891\\t1\\t1275\\n905\\t4\\t1275\\n933\\t1\\t1275\\n952\\t6\\t1275\\n953\\t3\\t1275\\n977\\t1\\t1275\\n983\\t1\\t1275\\n1016\\t1\\t1275\\n1023\\t1\\t1275\\n1030\\t3\\t1275\\n1055\\t1\\t1275\\n1071\\t2\\t1275\\n1076\\t1\\t1275\\n1083\\t1\\t1275\\n1086\\t1\\t1275\\n1087\\t2\\t1275\\n1090\\t1\\t1275\\n1135\\t1\\t1275\\n1147\\t1\\t1275\\n1210\\t2\\t1275\\n1254\\t1\\t1275\\n1256\\t1\\t1275\\n1260\\t5\\t1275\\n1275\\t26\\t1275\\n1276\\t4\\t1275\\n1278\\t2\\t1275\\n1280\\t2\\t1275\\n1283\\t1\\t1275\\n1285\\t2\\t1275\\n1286\\t1\\t1275\\n1287\\t1\\t1275\\n1290\\t1\\t1275\\n1301\\t1\\t1275\\n1302\\t14\\t1275\\n1335\\t1\\t1275\\n1355\\t2\\t1275\\n1369\\t2\\t1275\\n1373\\t1\\t1275\\n1380\\t2\\t1275\\n1390\\t1\\t1275\\n1397\\t3\\t1275\\n1417\\t1\\t1275\\n1418\\t1\\t1275\\n1428\\t1\\t1275\\n1432\\t3\\t1275\\n1451\\t1\\t1275\\n1451\\t1\\t1275\\n.I 1276\\n.T\\nSerial Literature Used by American Geologists\\n.A\\nGross, P.L.K.\\nWoodford, A.O.\\n.W\\n  The present investigation deals with the serial\\nliterature of geology, including mineralogy.

It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an \\ninordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of \\nantecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough \\nscholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they \\ncould be located quickly.  The citation index makes this check practicable.  \\nEven if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing \\nthe citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort\\nrequired to compile it.\\n  This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a \\nnew approach to subject control of the literature of science.  By virtue of \\nits different construction, it tends to bring together material that would \\nnever be collated by the usual subject indexing.  It is best described as an \\nassociation-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway\\nas he requires.  Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by\\nconventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject\\nheading.\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t1277\\n37\\t1\\t1277\\n39\\t2\\t1277\\n40\\t1\\t1277\\n41\\t1\\t1277\\n47\\t2\\t1277\\n50\\t1\\t1277\\n88\\t1\\t1277\\n97\\t1\\t1277\\n102\\t1\\t1277\\n103\\t1\\t1277\\n175\\t1\\t1277\\n233\\t1\\t1277\\n253\\t1\\t1277\\n313\\t1\\t1277\\n359\\t1\\t1277\\n377\\t3\\t1277\\n379\\t1\\t1277\\n395\\t1\\t1277\\n485\\t1\\t1277\\n486\\t1\\t1277\\n503\\t1\\t1277\\n505\\t1\\t1277\\n560\\t1\\t1277\\n573\\t1\\t1277\\n618\\t1\\t1277\\n632\\t2\\t1277\\n635\\t1\\t1277\\n667\\t1\\t1277\\n713\\t1\\t1277\\n748\\t1\\t1277\\n749\\t1\\t1277\\n751\\t1\\t1277\\n764\\t1\\t1277\\n765\\t1\\t1277\\n777\\t1\\t1277\\n778\\t1\\t1277\\n782\\t1\\t1277\\n804\\t1\\t1277\\n805\\t1\\t1277\\n893\\t1\\t1277\\n952\\t1\\t1277\\n1010\\t1\\t1277\\n1016\\t1\\t1277\\n1061\\t1\\t1277\\n1085\\t1\\t1277\\n1086\\t1\\t1277\\n1087\\t1\\t1277\\n1182\\t1\\t1277\\n1200\\t1\\t1277\\n1234\\t1\\t1277\\n1274\\t2\\t1277\\n1277\\t8\\t1277\\n1278\\t1\\t1277\\n1280\\t2\\t1277\\n1283\\t1\\t1277\\n1285\\t3\\t1277\\n1287\\t3\\t1277\\n1301\\t1\\t1277\\n1302\\t2\\t1277\\n1304\\t1\\t1277\\n1313\\t2\\t1277\\n1338\\t1\\t1277\\n1344\\t1\\t1277\\n1347\\t2\\t1277\\n1380\\t1\\t1277\\n1428\\t1\\t1277\\n1444\\t1\\t1277\\n1444\\t1\\t1277\\n.I

Deviations from the\\nexponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If the\\ntotal number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from\\nthe curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles\\ngrows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations from\\nan exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two\\n\"pauses\" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel\\nto the theoretical curve.  The well-known hypothesis of exponential\\ngrowth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less\\nthan half that found by Price and other investigators.\\tThe discrepancy

This article presents some\\nbasic aspects of SDI systems and describes recent developments and problems..\\nTwo different approaches to indexing information for SDI systems are discussed,\\nwith emphasis on the desirability of using enumerative hierarchical \\nclassifications to improve the precision and quality of matching scientists \\nwith useful documents..\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t1298\\n34\\t1\\t1298\\n35\\t1\\t1298\\n42\\t1\\t1298\\n43\\t1\\t1298\\n49\\t1\\t1298\\n52\\t1\\t1298\\n53\\t1\\t1298\\n59\\t2\\t1298\\n70\\t1\\t1298\\n73\\t1\\t1298\\n81\\t1\\t1298\\n91\\t1\\t1298\\n95\\t1\\t1298\\n105\\t1\\t1298\\n111\\t1\\t1298\\n113\\t1\\t1298\\n161\\t2\\t1298\\n163\\t1\\t1298\\n164\\t3\\t1298\\n175\\t1\\t1298\\n197\\t1\\t1298\\n202\\t1\\t1298\\n213\\t1\\t1298\\n224\\t2\\t1298\\n243\\t2\\t1298\\n255\\t1\\t1298\\n274\\t1\\t1298\\n356\\t1\\t1298\\n375\\t1\\t1298\\n382\\t1\\t1298\\n401\\t1\\t1298\\n420\\t1\\t1298\\n421\\t2\\t1298\\n439\\t1\\t1298\\n440\\t1\\t1298\\n445\\t1\\t1298\\n454\\t1\\t1298\\n465\\t1\\t1298\\n466\\t1\\t1298\\n467\\t1\\t1298\\n472\\t1\\t1298\\n490\\t1\\t1298\\n491\\t1\\t1298\\n503\\t1\\t1298\\n506\\t2\\t1298\\n507\\t2\\t1298\\n510\\t1\\t1298\\n512\\t1\\t1298\\n545\\t1\\t1298\\n554\\t1\\t1298\\n560\\t1\\t1298\\n565\\t1\\t1298\\n566\\t1\\t1298\\n578\\t1\\t1298\\n579\\t1\\t1298\\n580\\t1\\t1298\\n582\\t1\\t1298\\n589\\t1\\t1298\\n591\\t2\\t1298\\n592\\t2\\t1298\\n593\\t1\\t1298\\n594\\t2\\t1298\\n595\\t3\\t1298\\n596\\t1\\t1298\\n597\\t1\\t1298\\n599\\t1\\t1298\\n600\\t1\\t1298\\n602\\t1\\t1298\\n603\\t2\\t1298\\n604\\t2\\t1298\\n606\\t1\\t1298\\n607\\t1\\t1298\\n609\\t2\\t1298\\n622\\t1\\t1298\\n623\\t1\\t1298\\n629\\t1\\t1298\\n633\\t1\\t1298\\n639\\t1\\t1298\\n655\\t1\\t1298\\n656\\t1\\t1298\\n657\\t1\\t1298\\n659\\t1\\t1298\\n676\\t1\\t1298\\n696\\t1\\t1298\\n711\\t1\\t1298\\n716\\t1\\t1298\\n722\\t1\\t1298\\n723\\t2\\t1298\\n724\\t1\\t1298\\n726\\t1\\t1298\\n727\\t1\\t1298\\n728\\t1\\t1298\\n730\\t1\\t1298\\n731\\t1\\t1298\\n732\\t1\\t1298\\n735\\t1\\t1298\\n801\\t1\\t1298\\n805\\t1\\t1298\\n806\\t1\\t1298\\n807\\t1\\t1298\\n809\\t2\\t1298\\n810\\t1\\t1298\\n813\\t2\\t1298\\n814\\t1\\t1298\\n820\\t1\\t1298\\n822\\t1\\t1298\\n828\\t1\\t1298\\n836\\t1\\t1298\\n866\\t1\\t1298\\n867\\t1\\t1298\\n870\\t2\\t1298\\n879\\t1\\t1298\\n956\\t1\\t1298\\n989\\t1\\t1298\\n1030\\t1\\t1298\\n1054\\t1\\t1298\\n1084\\t1\\t1298\\n1087\\t1\\t1298\\n1089\\t1\\t1298\\n1091\\t1\\t1298\\n1154\\t1\\t1298\\n1232\\t1\\t1298\\n1281\\t1\\t1298\\n1283\\t1\\t1298\\n1293\\t1\\t1298\\n1294\\t1\\t1298\\n1295\\t1\\t1298\\n1296\\t1\\t1298\\n1298\\t12\\t1298\\n1299\\t2\\t1298\\n1303\\t1\\t1298\\n1327\\t2\\t1298\\n1346\\t1\\t1298\\n1347\\t1\\t1298\\n1363\\t1\\t1298\\n1366\\t1\\t1298\\n1367\\t1\\t1298\\n1368\\t1\\t1298\\n1396\\t3\\t1298\\n1405\\t1\\t1298\\n1405\\t1\\t1298\\n.I 1299\\n.T\\nCurrent Physics Information\\n.A\\nKoch, H.

It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has\\nexpanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very\\npractical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it\\npossible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or \\ntelegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information\\ncommunicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these\\ntwo qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these\\nproblems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication\\nengineer and can now be discussed quantitatively.\\n  From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical\\nand practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations.\\nOnce stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific\\ndiscussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell\\'s demon and to\\nshow a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The \\nthermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain\\nphysical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory,\\nit is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle\\nstates that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than\\nthe amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative\\nentropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The\\ngeneralized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of\\ninformation.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments\\nand is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics.\\n.X\\n3\\t1\\t1309\\n60\\t1\\t1309\\n85\\t1\\t1309\\n149\\t1\\t1309\\n175\\t1\\t1309\\n258\\t1\\t1309\\n324\\t1\\t1309\\n346\\t1\\t1309\\n361\\t1\\t1309\\n388\\t1\\t1309\\n416\\t1\\t1309\\n457\\t1\\t1309\\n558\\t1\\t1309\\n585\\t1\\t1309\\n592\\t1\\t1309\\n593\\t1\\t1309\\n595\\t1\\t1309\\n665\\t1\\t1309\\n761\\t1\\t1309\\n803\\t2\\t1309\\n911\\t1\\t1309\\n1022\\t1\\t1309\\n1053\\t1\\t1309\\n1077\\t1\\t1309\\n1218\\t1\\t1309\\n1309\\t7\\t1309\\n1309\\t7\\t1309\\n.I 1310\\n.T\\nTwo Paradigms for Scientific Knowledge?\\n.A\\nBloor, D.\\n.W\\n  The growing interest in the sociology of science makes the publication of\\nthis collection of papers particularly timely because, in broad outline,\\nit deals with the clash which occurs when the sociological approach makes\\nincursions into the field normally occupied by philosophers of science.\\n.X\\n88\\t1\\t1310\\n101\\t1\\t1310\\n168\\t1\\t1310\\n343\\t2\\t1310\\n902\\t1\\t1310\\n1271\\t1\\t1310\\n1272\\t1\\t1310\\n1310\\t5\\t1310\\n1311\\t1\\t1310\\n1386\\t2\\t1310\\n1399\\t1\\t1310\\n1399\\t1\\t1310\\n.I 1311\\n.T\\nIs a Scientific Revolution Taking Place in Psychology? - \\nDoubts and Reservations\\n.A\\nWarren, N.\\n.W\\n  We were introduced by Kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a series\\nof qualitative changes, each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigm\\nof thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science.\\nPalermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn\\'s analysis.

Second, I will outline Popper\\'s account of objectivity.  Third,\\nI will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach is\\nseriously misleading.

The book could also help persons in\\nmanagement positions of organizations in which the establishment of a\\nlibrary is contemplated, presenting, if only from a review of the contents,\\nthe scope of such a department.

It used to be believed that\\nthe results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous\\nprogressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War and\\nthen the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as\\neasily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have been\\nraised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only\\nmeans of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves,\\nfaced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively\\nfor the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with\\nthe social and economic developments which are occurring around\\nthem.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to\\ninvestigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are\\nresponsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible\\nsteps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a\\ndestructive utilization of science.\\n.X\\n37\\t1\\t1330\\n63\\t1\\t1330\\n771\\t1\\t1330\\n965\\t1\\t1330\\n1030\\t1\\t1330\\n1099\\t1\\t1330\\n1158\\t1\\t1330\\n1330\\t7\\t1330\\n1330\\t7\\t1330\\n.I 1331\\n.T\\nSocial Mobility in Industrial Society\\n.A\\nLipset, S.M.\\n.W\\n  In the present study, Professors Lipset and Bendix cast doubt\\non the validity of a number of widely accepted generalizations\\nrelating to social mobility: particularly (1) that there has been\\nsubstantially less mobility in Europe than in the United States,\\n(2) that social mobility tends to decline as industrial societies\\nmature, and (3) that opportunities for entrance into the business\\nelite become more restricted with mature industrialization.

The first\\nstep into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of South\\nand East Africa, including, from south to north, the species Papio\\nursinus, cynocephalus and anubis.

The interdependent behavior of many\\npeople in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form\\nor structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate\\ncollective level.  Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory\\nbecause of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social\\nstructures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand,\\nfurnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, our\\neffort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization of\\nan open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations.   \\n.X\\n15\\t1\\t1333\\n139\\t1\\t1333\\n274\\t1\\t1333\\n298\\t1\\t1333\\n312\\t1\\t1333\\n348\\t1\\t1333\\n356\\t2\\t1333\\n436\\t1\\t1333\\n437\\t1\\t1333\\n954\\t1\\t1333\\n957\\t1\\t1333\\n959\\t1\\t1333\\n962\\t1\\t1333\\n1005\\t1\\t1333\\n1018\\t1\\t1333\\n1036\\t1\\t1333\\n1041\\t1\\t1333\\n1065\\t1\\t1333\\n1067\\t1\\t1333\\n1149\\t1\\t1333\\n1150\\t1\\t1333\\n1154\\t1\\t1333\\n1186\\t2\\t1333\\n1187\\t2\\t1333\\n1205\\t1\\t1333\\n1240\\t1\\t1333\\n1333\\t11\\t1333\\n1348\\t1\\t1333\\n1353\\t1\\t1333\\n1384\\t1\\t1333\\n1406\\t1\\t1333\\n1406\\t1\\t1333\\n.I 1334\\n.T\\nCognitive, Technical and Social Factors\\nin the Growth of Radio Astronomy\\n.A\\nMulkay, M.J.\\nEdge, D.O.\\n.W\\n  We have tried in this paper to describe some of the main features of the\\nemergence and growth of radio astronomy, with special reference to the crucial\\ndevelopments occurring in the UK.

Who published what and where therefore becomes a central \\nquestion in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular\\nscientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number of\\ninvestigations concerning the career of such publications.  This\\ncareer, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages.\\n1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulates\\nit to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal\\nmeetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971).\\n2) Publication.

Social scientists are trying to\\ndetermine the extent to which so-called \"irrelevant\" characteristics\\ninfluence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions\\nand eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income,\\nprestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society,\\nscience has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Little\\nis known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This book\\nexamines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratification\\nof individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance,\\nor does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment?\\nA more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether\\nuniversalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for\\nrecognition in the social system of science.\\n.X\\n48\\t2\\t1337\\n55\\t1\\t1337\\n99\\t1\\t1337\\n100\\t1\\t1337\\n102\\t2\\t1337\\n106\\t1\\t1337\\n108\\t2\\t1337\\n113\\t2\\t1337\\n170\\t1\\t1337\\n314\\t1\\t1337\\n545\\t1\\t1337\\n592\\t1\\t1337\\n632\\t1\\t1337\\n747\\t1\\t1337\\n777\\t1\\t1337\\n791\\t1\\t1337\\n893\\t1\\t1337\\n1085\\t1\\t1337\\n1087\\t1\\t1337\\n1200\\t1\\t1337\\n1270\\t1\\t1337\\n1273\\t2\\t1337\\n1274\\t1\\t1337\\n1285\\t3\\t1337\\n1287\\t1\\t1337\\n1291\\t1\\t1337\\n1301\\t2\\t1337\\n1304\\t2\\t1337\\n1313\\t1\\t1337\\n1320\\t1\\t1337\\n1337\\t6\\t1337\\n1338\\t3\\t1337\\n1344\\t1\\t1337\\n1347\\t1\\t1337\\n1386\\t1\\t1337\\n1387\\t1\\t1337\\n1444\\t1\\t1337\\n1444\\t1\\t1337\\n.I 1338\\n.T\\nNotes and Letters\\n.A\\nMoravcsik, M.J.\\nMurugesan, P.\\n.W\\n  We tried to concentrate on a few variables that might define the\\nnature of a citation, and to keep the rest of the variables constant.

It is the means by which the individual\\nscientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work to\\ngain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain his\\nknowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for \\nthe allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it is\\na means of exercising social control.\\n    The informal communication system, although important, is the distaff\\nside.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory\\nrewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by\\nthe social system through informal systems of communication, though it is\\ngrowing in importance as an information dissemination system.\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t1341\\n39\\t1\\t1341\\n41\\t1\\t1341\\n48\\t1\\t1341\\n50\\t1\\t1341\\n89\\t1\\t1341\\n102\\t2\\t1341\\n103\\t1\\t1341\\n104\\t1\\t1341\\n105\\t1\\t1341\\n108\\t1\\t1341\\n113\\t2\\t1341\\n233\\t2\\t1341\\n473\\t1\\t1341\\n632\\t1\\t1341\\n748\\t1\\t1341\\n784\\t2\\t1341\\n791\\t1\\t1341\\n893\\t2\\t1341\\n1082\\t1\\t1341\\n1085\\t1\\t1341\\n1273\\t1\\t1341\\n1274\\t1\\t1341\\n1285\\t1\\t1341\\n1286\\t1\\t1341\\n1287\\t2\\t1341\\n1291\\t1\\t1341\\n1302\\t1\\t1341\\n1304\\t1\\t1341\\n1313\\t1\\t1341\\n1335\\t1\\t1341\\n1338\\t2\\t1341\\n1341\\t5\\t1341\\n1344\\t1\\t1341\\n1346\\t1\\t1341\\n1347\\t1\\t1341\\n1444\\t1\\t1341\\n1444\\t1\\t1341\\n.I 1342\\n.T\\nProblem Areas and Research Networks in Science\\n.A\\nMulkay, M.

Research \\nnetworks are seen to pass through three phases.. The first, exploratory phase \\nis distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and\\nby the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems.. The second phase is one of\\nrapid growth, associated with increasing social and intellectual integration,\\nmade possible by improved communication.. An increasingly precise scientific\\nconsensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation, in which those\\nparticipants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence.. \\nBut as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically\\nfruitful; and as the network grows, career opportunities diminish.. \\nConsequently, the third, final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the\\nnetwork, together with the movement of participants to new areas of \\nscientific opportunity..\\n.X\\n99\\t1\\t1342\\n103\\t1\\t1342\\n104\\t1\\t1342\\n108\\t2\\t1342\\n170\\t1\\t1342\\n893\\t1\\t1342\\n1063\\t1\\t1342\\n1234\\t1\\t1342\\n1273\\t1\\t1342\\n1274\\t1\\t1342\\n1300\\t1\\t1342\\n1313\\t1\\t1342\\n1315\\t1\\t1342\\n1334\\t2\\t1342\\n1342\\t6\\t1342\\n1343\\t3\\t1342\\n1345\\t1\\t1342\\n1387\\t1\\t1342\\n1444\\t1\\t1342\\n1444\\t1\\t1342\\n.I 1343\\n.T\\nThe Seven Sexes: A Study in the Sociology of a Phenomenon, or the \\nReplication of Experiments in Physics\\n.A\\nCollins, H.

Those historians and philosophers of science who express this\\npoint of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral\\npart of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop a\\npyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists..\\nAn alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible\\nfor advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of \\nthe eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National\\nAcademy members of today, are the \"pedestrians\" of history..\\n   This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the\\nfield of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawn\\nfrom a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from\\na subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third\\nfrom a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data \\nindicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by\\nvarious types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the \\nphysicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the \\nresearch produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implications\\nof these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas\\nfor necessary future research are suggested..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t1346\\n39\\t1\\t1346\\n48\\t2\\t1346\\n89\\t4\\t1346\\n102\\t3\\t1346\\n104\\t2\\t1346\\n105\\t3\\t1346\\n106\\t2\\t1346\\n110\\t2\\t1346\\n111\\t2\\t1346\\n112\\t1\\t1346\\n113\\t5\\t1346\\n155\\t1\\t1346\\n157\\t1\\t1346\\n161\\t1\\t1346\\n163\\t1\\t1346\\n170\\t1\\t1346\\n243\\t1\\t1346\\n312\\t1\\t1346\\n314\\t1\\t1346\\n356\\t3\\t1346\\n456\\t1\\t1346\\n544\\t2\\t1346\\n545\\t2\\t1346\\n560\\t4\\t1346\\n582\\t1\\t1346\\n592\\t1\\t1346\\n602\\t1\\t1346\\n607\\t1\\t1346\\n632\\t1\\t1346\\n656\\t1\\t1346\\n685\\t1\\t1346\\n784\\t1\\t1346\\n793\\t1\\t1346\\n893\\t1\\t1346\\n1030\\t2\\t1346\\n1050\\t1\\t1346\\n1062\\t2\\t1346\\n1200\\t1\\t1346\\n1234\\t1\\t1346\\n1256\\t1\\t1346\\n1273\\t1\\t1346\\n1280\\t1\\t1346\\n1284\\t1\\t1346\\n1285\\t4\\t1346\\n1286\\t1\\t1346\\n1287\\t3\\t1346\\n1290\\t1\\t1346\\n1291\\t3\\t1346\\n1293\\t2\\t1346\\n1294\\t1\\t1346\\n1295\\t1\\t1346\\n1296\\t2\\t1346\\n1297\\t1\\t1346\\n1298\\t1\\t1346\\n1300\\t1\\t1346\\n1302\\t2\\t1346\\n1308\\t1\\t1346\\n1319\\t1\\t1346\\n1340\\t2\\t1346\\n1341\\t1\\t1346\\n1344\\t1\\t1346\\n1346\\t9\\t1346\\n1347\\t3\\t1346\\n1386\\t2\\t1346\\n1444\\t1\\t1346\\n1444\\t1\\t1346\\n.I 1347\\n.T\\nInputs, Outputs, and the Prestige of University Science Departments\\n.A\\nHagstrom, Warren O.\\n.W\\n   This paper reports correlates of departmental prestige (American Council on\\nEducation rating of the quality of graduate faculty, 1966) for a sample of 125\\ndepartments in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.. The analysis \\nmostly uses multivariate linear regression.. Large and significant correlations\\nwith departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, research\\nproduction, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality of\\nPhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six to\\nnine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the \\nvariance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are held\\nconstant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly\\nassociated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates of\\ninbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differences\\nin the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied.. It is\\nshown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientific\\ncommunication and with departmental morale even after possible confounding\\nvariables are held constant..\\n.X\\n19\\t1\\t1347\\n37\\t1\\t1347\\n39\\t2\\t1347\\n40\\t1\\t1347\\n41\\t1\\t1347\\n47\\t1\\t1347\\n48\\t1\\t1347\\n88\\t2\\t1347\\n89\\t1\\t1347\\n97\\t1\\t1347\\n99\\t1\\t1347\\n102\\t3\\t1347\\n103\\t2\\t1347\\n104\\t1\\t1347\\n105\\t1\\t1347\\n106\\t1\\t1347\\n107\\t1\\t1347\\n110\\t2\\t1347\\n111\\t3\\t1347\\n112\\t2\\t1347\\n113\\t4\\t1347\\n161\\t1\\t1347\\n163\\t1\\t1347\\n170\\t2\\t1347\\n233\\t1\\t1347\\n243\\t1\\t1347\\n253\\t1\\t1347\\n313\\t1\\t1347\\n356\\t1\\t1347\\n359\\t1\\t1347\\n377\\t1\\t1347\\n379\\t1\\t1347\\n395\\t1\\t1347\\n456\\t1\\t1347\\n505\\t1\\t1347\\n545\\t2\\t1347\\n560\\t3\\t1347\\n573\\t1\\t1347\\n592\\t1\\t1347\\n602\\t1\\t1347\\n607\\t1\\t1347\\n618\\t1\\t1347\\n632\\t2\\t1347\\n635\\t1\\t1347\\n667\\t1\\t1347\\n748\\t1\\t1347\\n749\\t1\\t1347\\n751\\t1\\t1347\\n764\\t1\\t1347\\n765\\t1\\t1347\\n777\\t1\\t1347\\n778\\t1\\t1347\\n782\\t1\\t1347\\n784\\t1\\t1347\\n793\\t1\\t1347\\n804\\t1\\t1347\\n805\\t1\\t1347\\n893\\t1\\t1347\\n952\\t1\\t1347\\n1010\\t1\\t1347\\n1016\\t1\\t1347\\n1030\\t1\\t1347\\n1061\\t1\\t1347\\n1062\\t1\\t1347\\n1085\\t1\\t1347\\n1086\\t1\\t1347\\n1087\\t1\\t1347\\n1182\\t1\\t1347\\n1200\\t1\\t1347\\n1273\\t1\\t1347\\n1274\\t1\\t1347\\n1277\\t2\\t1347\\n1278\\t1\\t1347\\n1280\\t1\\t1347\\n1283\\t1\\t1347\\n1285\\t2\\t1347\\n1287\\t3\\t1347\\n1291\\t1\\t1347\\n1293\\t1\\t1347\\n1296\\t1\\t1347\\n1298\\t1\\t1347\\n1300\\t1\\t1347\\n1301\\t1\\t1347\\n1302\\t4\\t1347\\n1304\\t2\\t1347\\n1313\\t1\\t1347\\n1315\\t1\\t1347\\n1320\\t1\\t1347\\n1337\\t1\\t1347\\n1338\\t1\\t1347\\n1340\\t1\\t1347\\n1341\\t1\\t1347\\n1344\\t4\\t1347\\n1345\\t1\\t1347\\n1346\\t3\\t1347\\n1347\\t9\\t1347\\n1380\\t1\\t1347\\n1428\\t1\\t1347\\n1444\\t2\\t1347\\n1444\\t2\\t1347\\n.I 1348\\n.T\\nSociology and Modern system Theory\\n.A\\nBuckley, W.\\n.W\\n  This book is intended as an exploratory sketch of a revolutionary\\nscientific perspective and conceptual framework as it might be applied\\nto the sociocultural system.  This point of view and still developing\\nframework, as interpreted here, stems from the General Systems Research\\nmovement and the now closely allied fields of cybernetics and information\\nor communication theory.  The principal goal of the book is to bring to the\\nattention of a larger number of social scientists, particularly sociologists,\\nthe wealth of principles, ideas, and insights that have already brought a\\nhigher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas of\\nbiology, psychology, and some physical sciences to say nothing of the\\napplied areas of technology to which they are essential.\\n.X\\n308\\t1\\t1348\\n435\\t1\\t1348\\n557\\t1\\t1348\\n1036\\t1\\t1348\\n1067\\t2\\t1348\\n1069\\t1\\t1348\\n1333\\t1\\t1348\\n1340\\t1\\t1348\\n1348\\t7\\t1348\\n1389\\t1\\t1348\\n1389\\t1\\t1348\\n.I 1349\\n.T\\nSources of Information in the Social Sciences\\n.A\\nWhite, C.M.\\n.W\\n  Documentation in the social sciences is varied in form and content,\\nwritten for people in many walks of life, and fills several miles of shelving\\nin libraries that try to keep up with it.  Graduate students who qualify for\\npositions as professional librarians have to learn about this vast\\npreserve, and it is their need of guidance that explains the origin of this\\nbook.\\n  The task of this book is to place in the reader\\'s hands a sort of chart\\nand compass to use in finding his way around and learning how the system\\nworks.\\n  For each subject, the treatment falls into two parts.  First a specialist,\\nsought out for his grasp of the literature, presents a bibliographical\\nreview of basic monographic works for a collection of substantive material.\\nThis review is followed by a list of reference works.  Informative\\nannotations are provided for all works except those adequately explained\\nby the title.  Specialized works are included, especially when they exemplify\\ntypes of sources important for reference purposes.  First priority goes to\\nworks which may be looked upon as basic for a program of service to a\\ngeneral clientele made up of scholars, students and the public at large.\\nIf some stress falls on bibliographies, it is because they serve as controls\\nfor opening doorways to even vaster information and to sources that are\\nmore obscure.\\n.X\\n405\\t2\\t1349\\n1349\\t7\\t1349\\n1349\\t7\\t1349\\n.I 1350\\n.T\\nSoviet Bibliography\\n.A\\nLevin, M.I.\\n.W\\nThe first and most basic phase of research was the analysis of existing\\nbilbiographic publications.\\nThe chronicles of the All-Union Book Reserve, VINITI abstract journals,\\npublications of subject information centers and main libraries, bulletins of\\nnew publications, as well as the main current foreign bibliography on some\\nbranches of knowledge were considered.\\nAfter comparative analysis valuable data were obtained in the completeness\\nof registration of literature and the efficiency of its reflection in\\ndifferent publications; on the types of classificatory schemes and intermediate\\ninstruments, on the quality of abstracts.\\nThe merits and drawbacks of basic bibliographic publications were shown, and\\nrecommendations for improving present bibliographic systems were suggested.\\n.X\\n1101\\t1\\t1350\\n1104\\t2\\t1350\\n1190\\t2\\t1350\\n1350\\t7\\t1350\\n1350\\t7\\t1350\\n.I 1351\\n.T\\nThe Special Cataloguing\\n.A\\nHorner, J.\\n.W\\n  We feel, meanwhile, that many materials can be covered by general\\nor representative principles and rules.

Secondly, in between come\\nchapters dealing with individual categories of materials in detail.  Each\\ncategory receives two types of treatment.

These\\ntypes are the SDI type, the intermediate type\\nsuch as NASA\\'s SCAN program, and the unselected\\ntype such as the usual library accession\\nlist.  A fourth type, the indexing and\\nabstracting journal is defined but not related\\nto the other three types.  The three current\\nawareness publications are shown to have a\\nrelationship in terms of the number of\\nrequests they can produce from a given set of\\nreferences or notices.  The SDI system will\\nproduce about one request from ten notices;\\nthe intermediate type about one request per\\nhundred notices; ad the unselected type,\\none request per thousand notices.  Despite\\nthe differences in the number of notices to\\ngenerate one request, the cost to produce one\\nrequest is about the same for the three types\\nof tools.  Also, the usage of these tools is\\nrelated to the amount of user time available\\nand a curve is presented based on various\\nassumptions to define this relationship.\\n.X\\n13\\t1\\t1363\\n18\\t1\\t1363\\n34\\t1\\t1363\\n49\\t1\\t1363\\n53\\t1\\t1363\\n59\\t1\\t1363\\n76\\t1\\t1363\\n121\\t2\\t1363\\n164\\t1\\t1363\\n202\\t1\\t1363\\n213\\t2\\t1363\\n224\\t1\\t1363\\n243\\t1\\t1363\\n348\\t1\\t1363\\n421\\t1\\t1363\\n465\\t2\\t1363\\n466\\t2\\t1363\\n490\\t1\\t1363\\n491\\t1\\t1363\\n506\\t1\\t1363\\n507\\t1\\t1363\\n510\\t1\\t1363\\n512\\t1\\t1363\\n582\\t1\\t1363\\n591\\t1\\t1363\\n595\\t1\\t1363\\n603\\t1\\t1363\\n604\\t1\\t1363\\n622\\t1\\t1363\\n623\\t1\\t1363\\n629\\t1\\t1363\\n633\\t1\\t1363\\n639\\t1\\t1363\\n659\\t1\\t1363\\n676\\t1\\t1363\\n711\\t1\\t1363\\n720\\t1\\t1363\\n722\\t1\\t1363\\n723\\t1\\t1363\\n726\\t1\\t1363\\n728\\t1\\t1363\\n730\\t1\\t1363\\n731\\t1\\t1363\\n732\\t1\\t1363\\n809\\t1\\t1363\\n810\\t1\\t1363\\n813\\t1\\t1363\\n814\\t1\\t1363\\n820\\t1\\t1363\\n822\\t1\\t1363\\n828\\t1\\t1363\\n859\\t1\\t1363\\n870\\t1\\t1363\\n879\\t1\\t1363\\n914\\t1\\t1363\\n1091\\t1\\t1363\\n1283\\t1\\t1363\\n1298\\t1\\t1363\\n1299\\t1\\t1363\\n1362\\t2\\t1363\\n1363\\t5\\t1363\\n1366\\t1\\t1363\\n1367\\t1\\t1363\\n1368\\t1\\t1363\\n1396\\t1\\t1363\\n1396\\t1\\t1363\\n.I 1364\\n.T\\nThe New York Times Information Bank\\n.A\\nRothman, J.\\n.W\\n  The New York Times Information\\nBank is described in detail.

Locating university\\nlibraries near classrooms, offices, and\\ndormitories requires a larger budget\\nthan combining these libraries into a \\ncentralized facility.  Yet there is a cost\\nto the university community which does not \\nappear in the university budget - a cost\\nin time, energy, and decreased use resulting\\nfrom locating the library a longer distance\\nfrom users.

Totals were maintained for three areas of\\njournal usage according to: 1) the number of times patrons used current \\nissues, 2) the number of times the journal issues were reshelved by library \\nstaff, and 3) the number of times that journals were cited in articles by \\nApplied Physics Laboratory (APL) authors.  The survey resulted in a 9.6% \\nreduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additional \\nshelf space in which to display journals.

Lacking qualified persons to do literature searches,\\neither in the library or in the research groups, greater use should be made of \\nthe available computerized searches.\\n.X\\n18\\t1\\t1372\\n124\\t1\\t1372\\n127\\t2\\t1372\\n129\\t1\\t1372\\n145\\t1\\t1372\\n190\\t1\\t1372\\n191\\t1\\t1372\\n197\\t1\\t1372\\n211\\t1\\t1372\\n214\\t1\\t1372\\n218\\t1\\t1372\\n224\\t1\\t1372\\n243\\t1\\t1372\\n307\\t2\\t1372\\n330\\t1\\t1372\\n357\\t1\\t1372\\n376\\t1\\t1372\\n378\\t1\\t1372\\n450\\t1\\t1372\\n451\\t1\\t1372\\n452\\t1\\t1372\\n459\\t3\\t1372\\n468\\t2\\t1372\\n484\\t1\\t1372\\n492\\t1\\t1372\\n508\\t2\\t1372\\n511\\t1\\t1372\\n512\\t1\\t1372\\n514\\t1\\t1372\\n518\\t1\\t1372\\n520\\t1\\t1372\\n523\\t2\\t1372\\n524\\t2\\t1372\\n525\\t2\\t1372\\n526\\t1\\t1372\\n527\\t1\\t1372\\n529\\t2\\t1372\\n530\\t2\\t1372\\n534\\t2\\t1372\\n546\\t1\\t1372\\n547\\t1\\t1372\\n553\\t1\\t1372\\n579\\t1\\t1372\\n594\\t1\\t1372\\n603\\t1\\t1372\\n604\\t1\\t1372\\n606\\t1\\t1372\\n609\\t1\\t1372\\n610\\t1\\t1372\\n611\\t1\\t1372\\n612\\t1\\t1372\\n625\\t1\\t1372\\n626\\t1\\t1372\\n630\\t1\\t1372\\n633\\t1\\t1372\\n635\\t1\\t1372\\n636\\t2\\t1372\\n637\\t2\\t1372\\n642\\t2\\t1372\\n646\\t1\\t1372\\n648\\t1\\t1372\\n650\\t1\\t1372\\n692\\t1\\t1372\\n696\\t1\\t1372\\n699\\t1\\t1372\\n702\\t1\\t1372\\n703\\t2\\t1372\\n705\\t1\\t1372\\n708\\t1\\t1372\\n726\\t1\\t1372\\n727\\t1\\t1372\\n728\\t1\\t1372\\n730\\t1\\t1372\\n731\\t1\\t1372\\n732\\t2\\t1372\\n733\\t2\\t1372\\n734\\t2\\t1372\\n736\\t2\\t1372\\n738\\t1\\t1372\\n739\\t1\\t1372\\n740\\t1\\t1372\\n741\\t1\\t1372\\n742\\t1\\t1372\\n743\\t1\\t1372\\n744\\t1\\t1372\\n755\\t1\\t1372\\n820\\t1\\t1372\\n826\\t3\\t1372\\n827\\t2\\t1372\\n828\\t1\\t1372\\n845\\t1\\t1372\\n877\\t1\\t1372\\n879\\t3\\t1372\\n883\\t2\\t1372\\n885\\t1\\t1372\\n1004\\t1\\t1372\\n1035\\t1\\t1372\\n1078\\t1\\t1372\\n1089\\t1\\t1372\\n1091\\t1\\t1372\\n1207\\t1\\t1372\\n1264\\t2\\t1372\\n1297\\t1\\t1372\\n1303\\t1\\t1372\\n1356\\t4\\t1372\\n1364\\t1\\t1372\\n1368\\t2\\t1372\\n1370\\t3\\t1372\\n1372\\t8\\t1372\\n1373\\t1\\t1372\\n1374\\t5\\t1372\\n1375\\t2\\t1372\\n1376\\t2\\t1372\\n1377\\t2\\t1372\\n1383\\t1\\t1372\\n1396\\t2\\t1372\\n1396\\t2\\t1372\\n.I 1373\\n.T\\nHow Do Scientists Meet Their Information Needs?\\n.A\\nChen, C.\\n.W\\n  A survey of the information use patterns and communication practices\\nof academic physicists in the  greater Boston area reveals that academic \\nphysicists rely heavily on formal and informal sources of information.  Their\\nuse of formal publications concentrates on a small number of journal titles.  \\nTime and location factors play an important role\\nin their information seeking and gathering. A considerable number of the\\nphysicists surveyed do not seek librarians\\' help when searching for\\ninformation in the library.  Although libraries have been considered largely as\\nstorehouses of materials and librarians organizers of these materials, more \\nactive roles for librarians are possible.\\n.X\\n48\\t1\\t1373\\n124\\t1\\t1373\\n127\\t1\\t1373\\n129\\t1\\t1373\\n161\\t2\\t1373\\n167\\t1\\t1373\\n190\\t1\\t1373\\n191\\t1\\t1373\\n197\\t1\\t1373\\n211\\t1\\t1373\\n214\\t1\\t1373\\n218\\t1\\t1373\\n243\\t1\\t1373\\n295\\t1\\t1373\\n300\\t1\\t1373\\n307\\t1\\t1373\\n330\\t1\\t1373\\n358\\t1\\t1373\\n378\\t1\\t1373\\n433\\t1\\t1373\\n450\\t1\\t1373\\n451\\t1\\t1373\\n452\\t1\\t1373\\n459\\t1\\t1373\\n468\\t1\\t1373\\n470\\t1\\t1373\\n484\\t1\\t1373\\n492\\t1\\t1373\\n508\\t1\\t1373\\n511\\t1\\t1373\\n512\\t1\\t1373\\n514\\t1\\t1373\\n518\\t1\\t1373\\n520\\t1\\t1373\\n523\\t1\\t1373\\n524\\t1\\t1373\\n525\\t1\\t1373\\n526\\t1\\t1373\\n529\\t1\\t1373\\n530\\t1\\t1373\\n534\\t1\\t1373\\n546\\t1\\t1373\\n553\\t1\\t1373\\n579\\t1\\t1373\\n594\\t1\\t1373\\n603\\t1\\t1373\\n604\\t1\\t1373\\n606\\t1\\t1373\\n609\\t1\\t1373\\n610\\t1\\t1373\\n611\\t1\\t1373\\n612\\t1\\t1373\\n614\\t1\\t1373\\n624\\t1\\t1373\\n625\\t1\\t1373\\n626\\t1\\t1373\\n630\\t1\\t1373\\n631\\t1\\t1373\\n635\\t1\\t1373\\n636\\t1\\t1373\\n637\\t1\\t1373\\n638\\t1\\t1373\\n642\\t1\\t1373\\n648\\t1\\t1373\\n650\\t1\\t1373\\n692\\t1\\t1373\\n696\\t1\\t1373\\n699\\t1\\t1373\\n703\\t1\\t1373\\n705\\t1\\t1373\\n708\\t1\\t1373\\n726\\t1\\t1373\\n727\\t1\\t1373\\n728\\t1\\t1373\\n731\\t1\\t1373\\n732\\t1\\t1373\\n733\\t1\\t1373\\n734\\t1\\t1373\\n736\\t1\\t1373\\n738\\t1\\t1373\\n739\\t1\\t1373\\n740\\t1\\t1373\\n741\\t1\\t1373\\n742\\t1\\t1373\\n743\\t1\\t1373\\n744\\t1\\t1373\\n748\\t1\\t1373\\n753\\t1\\t1373\\n755\\t1\\t1373\\n756\\t1\\t1373\\n757\\t1\\t1373\\n787\\t1\\t1373\\n792\\t1\\t1373\\n820\\t1\\t1373\\n821\\t1\\t1373\\n826\\t1\\t1373\\n827\\t1\\t1373\\n831\\t1\\t1373\\n879\\t1\\t1373\\n883\\t1\\t1373\\n937\\t1\\t1373\\n946\\t1\\t1373\\n952\\t1\\t1373\\n953\\t1\\t1373\\n1004\\t1\\t1373\\n1035\\t1\\t1373\\n1056\\t1\\t1373\\n1078\\t1\\t1373\\n1083\\t1\\t1373\\n1089\\t1\\t1373\\n1091\\t1\\t1373\\n1200\\t1\\t1373\\n1207\\t1\\t1373\\n1210\\t1\\t1373\\n1254\\t1\\t1373\\n1256\\t1\\t1373\\n1260\\t1\\t1373\\n1264\\t1\\t1373\\n1275\\t1\\t1373\\n1278\\t1\\t1373\\n1297\\t1\\t1373\\n1302\\t1\\t1373\\n1303\\t1\\t1373\\n1356\\t1\\t1373\\n1364\\t1\\t1373\\n1368\\t1\\t1373\\n1369\\t1\\t1373\\n1370\\t1\\t1373\\n1372\\t1\\t1373\\n1373\\t5\\t1373\\n1374\\t1\\t1373\\n1375\\t1\\t1373\\n1376\\t1\\t1373\\n1377\\t1\\t1373\\n1418\\t1\\t1373\\n1418\\t1\\t1373\\n.I 1374\\n.T\\nCost Comparison of Manual and On-Line Computerized\\nLiterature Searching\\n.A\\nElman, S.A.\\n.W\\n  Cost and searching time comparisons are made between manual and on-line\\nliterature searches.

Add to this a\\nchronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of\\nclassification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period\\na bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the\\nactivities of the human mind.\\n  My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical\\napplication to library work and the compilation of subject\\nbibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered in\\nrelation to the growth of modern civilization.\\n  Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends\\nwith the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their final\\ninterpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary\\nqualifications.  I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to\\nfurnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors\\nwhich are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have\\noutstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.

The mathematics\\nwith which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs,\\nor more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurations\\ncalled digraphs, which consist of \"points\" and \"directed lines.\"  When\\nthese terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematical\\nmodels of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflect\\nstructural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematical\\nterms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory has\\napplicability to many different fields of investigation.\\n.X\\n26\\t1\\t1385\\n109\\t1\\t1385\\n484\\t1\\t1385\\n654\\t1\\t1385\\n855\\t1\\t1385\\n972\\t1\\t1385\\n1232\\t1\\t1385\\n1385\\t5\\t1385\\n1427\\t1\\t1385\\n1427\\t1\\t1385\\n.I 1386\\n.T\\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\n.A\\nKuhn, T.S.\\n.B\\n1962\\n.W\\n  The essay that follows is the first full published report on a\\nproject originally conceived almost fifteen years ago.

The basic\\nrequirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement\\nof a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and\\nretrieved from, an ordered file.\\n   While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex\\nterms or even single words, it always becomes\\nevident that single words are often insufficient to express a\\nsubject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex.\\nTo express such subjects requires either that their constituent\\nconcepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined,\\nor that only one part of the subject be shown.\\n   The former solution requires that the indexer perform\\nthe necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the\\nconstituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latter\\nforces the seeker of information to sort through many items\\nto find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and\\nma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the\\nconcept an entry should be made.\\n.X\\n16\\t1\\t1392\\n114\\t2\\t1392\\n154\\t1\\t1392\\n169\\t1\\t1392\\n194\\t1\\t1392\\n212\\t1\\t1392\\n235\\t1\\t1392\\n250\\t1\\t1392\\n289\\t2\\t1392\\n345\\t1\\t1392\\n400\\t1\\t1392\\n404\\t1\\t1392\\n458\\t1\\t1392\\n459\\t1\\t1392\\n493\\t1\\t1392\\n548\\t1\\t1392\\n627\\t2\\t1392\\n770\\t1\\t1392\\n796\\t1\\t1392\\n802\\t1\\t1392\\n863\\t1\\t1392\\n864\\t1\\t1392\\n897\\t1\\t1392\\n990\\t1\\t1392\\n1073\\t1\\t1392\\n1152\\t1\\t1392\\n1368\\t1\\t1392\\n1392\\t8\\t1392\\n1414\\t1\\t1392\\n1431\\t1\\t1392\\n1448\\t2\\t1392\\n1448\\t2\\t1392\\n.I 1393\\n.T\\nThe Subject Approach to Information\\n.A\\nFoskett, A.C.\\n.W\\n  The first edition of this book, published in 1969, was prompted\\nby changes in the Library Association syllabus which for the first time\\nenables lecturers to treat classification and subject cataloging as\\ndifferent aspects of the same topic.  These changes coincided with the\\npublication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showed\\nclearly that all indexing languages are basically the same.  However,\\nalthough it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was no\\none textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I felt\\nwas needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and its\\nreception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill a\\nreal need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and -\\nmore importantly - from students, particularly in the United States,\\nwhere British textbooks on classification had previously been regarded\\nwith something akin to suspicion.

In this country it\\nhas almost completely displaced the latter.  The principal classed catalogs   \\nnow remaining are those of the Engineering Societies Library in New York,\\nthe John Crerar Library in Chicago, and the Science and Technology Department\\nof the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  There are, nevertheless, many things\\nto commend the classed catalog.  Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument between\\nthe classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both\\nand explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical\\ncatalog is concerned.  However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for\\none not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no\\napproach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not\\nin fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library\\'s\\ncollections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced.\\n.X\\n79\\t1\\t1395\\n92\\t1\\t1395\\n159\\t1\\t1395\\n235\\t1\\t1395\\n246\\t1\\t1395\\n247\\t1\\t1395\\n324\\t1\\t1395\\n326\\t1\\t1395\\n333\\t1\\t1395\\n354\\t1\\t1395\\n361\\t1\\t1395\\n382\\t1\\t1395\\n502\\t1\\t1395\\n608\\t1\\t1395\\n825\\t1\\t1395\\n838\\t1\\t1395\\n874\\t1\\t1395\\n884\\t1\\t1395\\n887\\t1\\t1395\\n892\\t1\\t1395\\n950\\t1\\t1395\\n966\\t1\\t1395\\n970\\t1\\t1395\\n991\\t1\\t1395\\n997\\t2\\t1395\\n998\\t1\\t1395\\n1000\\t1\\t1395\\n1153\\t1\\t1395\\n1216\\t2\\t1395\\n1265\\t1\\t1395\\n1266\\t2\\t1395\\n1394\\t1\\t1395\\n1395\\t9\\t1395\\n1421\\t1\\t1395\\n1441\\t1\\t1395\\n1445\\t1\\t1395\\n1445\\t1\\t1395\\n.I 1396\\n.T\\nSurvey of Commercially Available Computer-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases\\n.A\\nSchneider, John H.\\nGechman, Marvin\\nFurth, Stephen E.\\n.W\\n   This document contains the results of a survey of 94 US organizations, \\nand 36 organizations in other countries that were thought to prepare \\nmachine-readable data bases..

In this book I have tried to cover the\\nwhole subject, starting with introductory material and leading to the\\nmore advanced topics, assuming a minimal technical background on the\\npart of the reader.  I did not attempt to provide detailed techniques\\nfor the design of specific circuits, but rather to formulate methods and to\\ndevelop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems.\\nFor once such general principles are understood, the relevance of specific\\nprocedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter of\\nengineering decisions.\\n.X\\n228\\t1\\t1398\\n329\\t1\\t1398\\n397\\t3\\t1398\\n416\\t1\\t1398\\n417\\t3\\t1398\\n430\\t4\\t1398\\n442\\t1\\t1398\\n443\\t4\\t1398\\n455\\t4\\t1398\\n464\\t3\\t1398\\n495\\t1\\t1398\\n511\\t1\\t1398\\n524\\t1\\t1398\\n745\\t4\\t1398\\n1194\\t1\\t1398\\n1204\\t3\\t1398\\n1396\\t1\\t1398\\n1398\\t5\\t1398\\n1427\\t3\\t1398\\n1427\\t3\\t1398\\n.I 1399\\n.T\\nSyntactic Structures\\n.A\\nChomsky, N.\\n.W\\n  This study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense\\n(as opposed to semantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed to\\nphonemics and morphology).  It forms part of an attempt to construct\\na formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to\\nexplore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorous\\nformulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than\\nmere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established\\nmethods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed models\\nfor linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative\\nand positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precise\\nbut inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can\\noften expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently,\\ngain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.

The criticism usually relates to the\\nrecognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact-\\nfinding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in\\nthe research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  One\\ncan add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a\\nweek on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on\\noriginal research or the writing of proposals, which either are not\\nadequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  If\\nthe librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally\\ncriticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited\\ninterest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work there\\nare no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusions\\ninto action.\\n.X\\n128\\t1\\t1403\\n130\\t1\\t1403\\n171\\t1\\t1403\\n191\\t1\\t1403\\n217\\t1\\t1403\\n230\\t1\\t1403\\n232\\t1\\t1403\\n241\\t1\\t1403\\n243\\t1\\t1403\\n249\\t1\\t1403\\n331\\t1\\t1403\\n339\\t3\\t1403\\n358\\t1\\t1403\\n364\\t1\\t1403\\n370\\t1\\t1403\\n371\\t1\\t1403\\n376\\t1\\t1403\\n385\\t1\\t1403\\n387\\t3\\t1403\\n406\\t1\\t1403\\n453\\t1\\t1403\\n598\\t1\\t1403\\n616\\t1\\t1403\\n629\\t1\\t1403\\n648\\t1\\t1403\\n652\\t1\\t1403\\n779\\t1\\t1403\\n896\\t1\\t1403\\n923\\t1\\t1403\\n924\\t1\\t1403\\n946\\t1\\t1403\\n948\\t1\\t1403\\n1033\\t1\\t1403\\n1079\\t1\\t1403\\n1242\\t1\\t1403\\n1250\\t1\\t1403\\n1376\\t1\\t1403\\n1379\\t1\\t1403\\n1403\\t14\\t1403\\n1423\\t1\\t1403\\n1428\\t1\\t1403\\n1457\\t1\\t1403\\n1457\\t1\\t1403\\n.I 1404\\n.T\\nTechnical Libraries; users and their demands:\\na classification of user groups and user demands\\nin technical libraries\\n.A\\nSlater, M.\\n.W\\n        This study of the habits of customers of technical\\nlibraries and information departments had three main aims.\\n1.

The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional\\napproach in which the use of various means of information transfer is \\nconsidered in relation to the purposes of technical work..\\n   While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this\\nsort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will\\nvary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores\\nthe association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational,\\nand technological factors with variations in the use of sources of \\ninformation.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those\\nvariations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the\\ninformation was applied..\\n   The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions,\\none relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body\\nof systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational\\nobjectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal\\nsources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more\\ndistant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on \\n\"professional\" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge..\\n   In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have,\\nwithin an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the need \\nfor managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in\\nthis process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formal \\nand social groups.. Firms need to establish two-way communication about needs \\nand  possibilities; by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which\\nadvances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the\\nneeds of society..\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t1407\\n9\\t1\\t1407\\n32\\t1\\t1407\\n42\\t1\\t1407\\n96\\t1\\t1407\\n137\\t1\\t1407\\n152\\t1\\t1407\\n163\\t1\\t1407\\n206\\t1\\t1407\\n207\\t2\\t1407\\n208\\t1\\t1407\\n270\\t1\\t1407\\n272\\t1\\t1407\\n356\\t1\\t1407\\n456\\t1\\t1407\\n714\\t1\\t1407\\n761\\t1\\t1407\\n768\\t1\\t1407\\n774\\t1\\t1407\\n783\\t1\\t1407\\n799\\t1\\t1407\\n811\\t1\\t1407\\n816\\t1\\t1407\\n907\\t1\\t1407\\n913\\t1\\t1407\\n925\\t1\\t1407\\n961\\t1\\t1407\\n962\\t1\\t1407\\n964\\t1\\t1407\\n968\\t1\\t1407\\n1068\\t1\\t1407\\n1203\\t1\\t1407\\n1205\\t1\\t1407\\n1317\\t1\\t1407\\n1321\\t3\\t1407\\n1394\\t1\\t1407\\n1407\\t5\\t1407\\n1445\\t1\\t1407\\n1445\\t1\\t1407\\n.I 1408\\n.T\\nTechnology and Information Transfer\\n.A\\nRosenbloom, R.S.\\n.W\\n  In 1963 research at the Harvard Business School was initiated\\nby Richard Rosenbloom and Frank Wolek to describe the process\\nby which technical information is communicated and used.

The MARC records provided a search data base \\nfor an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with\\nbiweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified\\nfields of interest..\\n   Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in\\nparticipating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants\\ncould be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of \\nfaculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10, \\neconomics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3..\\n   An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both\\nLibrary of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading \\nterms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, \\nparenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF\\nbecomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting\\n\"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with\\nsubject headings and class numbers..\\n   The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC\\nrecords.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. \\nSubject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the\\nsum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than \\nthe hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a\\nparticular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a \\nhit would occur on any matching number..\\n   Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program\\nExtract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number \\n(accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current\\nrecords; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in\\nthe profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared\\nthese card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies \\nof each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty \\nmember\\'s own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used\\nfor making recommendations to the library..\\n   Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file\\nmainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, \\nwhereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record\\'s\\nsecond or third heading..\\n   The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting\\nrelevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73\\npercent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the\\nfaculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, \\nregular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to\\ntheir attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they\\notherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all\\nbut only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a \\nconvenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the\\namount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI \\nservice continued..\\n.X\\n59\\t1\\t1415\\n63\\t1\\t1415\\n64\\t1\\t1415\\n175\\t2\\t1415\\n243\\t1\\t1415\\n245\\t1\\t1415\\n355\\t1\\t1415\\n374\\t1\\t1415\\n382\\t1\\t1415\\n481\\t1\\t1415\\n482\\t1\\t1415\\n717\\t2\\t1415\\n718\\t1\\t1415\\n719\\t1\\t1415\\n781\\t1\\t1415\\n783\\t1\\t1415\\n834\\t1\\t1415\\n835\\t1\\t1415\\n848\\t1\\t1415\\n849\\t1\\t1415\\n850\\t1\\t1415\\n851\\t1\\t1415\\n852\\t1\\t1415\\n857\\t1\\t1415\\n859\\t1\\t1415\\n922\\t1\\t1415\\n925\\t1\\t1415\\n980\\t1\\t1415\\n981\\t1\\t1415\\n982\\t1\\t1415\\n1042\\t2\\t1415\\n1051\\t2\\t1415\\n1410\\t1\\t1415\\n1415\\t5\\t1415\\n1426\\t1\\t1415\\n1426\\t1\\t1415\\n.I 1416\\n.T\\nSynthesis, Identification and Control of Distributed Parameter Systems\\n.A\\nJain, Anil Kumar\\n.W\\n   Many synthesis, identification and control problems that arise in \\ndistributed parameter systems are studied..

Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage\\nsystem are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the \\ncriteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study\\ndemonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage \\nquantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the\\nsmall shelving costs associated with stored materials..\\n   Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the\\nother utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared..\\nFor the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical\\nage at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the \\nfraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the\\ncirculation rate of the books decline with age according to an average \\ngeometric pattern of obsolescence..\\n   The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is\\nutilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision\\nvariable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage \\nrate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that\\na book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being \\nused.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which \\nthe time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, \\nalthough the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite \\ndistribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon \\nthe circulation activities of the individual libraries..\\n   An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected\\nfrom three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters\\nextracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules\\nand the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from\\nstorage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the\\ncollection must be stored..\\n   Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the\\nlatter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation \\nwhere the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit \\nrelocation cost..\\n   Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values\\nshow that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively \\ninsignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the \\ncapacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; \\nand that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost\\ndifferential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather\\nsubjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a\\npotentially large influence on the decision rules..\\n.X\\n31\\t1\\t1417\\n33\\t1\\t1417\\n36\\t3\\t1417\\n41\\t2\\t1417\\n46\\t3\\t1417\\n57\\t1\\t1417\\n61\\t1\\t1417\\n62\\t2\\t1417\\n67\\t2\\t1417\\n70\\t1\\t1417\\n71\\t1\\t1417\\n72\\t1\\t1417\\n73\\t1\\t1417\\n81\\t1\\t1417\\n89\\t1\\t1417\\n97\\t1\\t1417\\n102\\t1\\t1417\\n111\\t1\\t1417\\n112\\t1\\t1417\\n115\\t1\\t1417\\n135\\t1\\t1417\\n163\\t1\\t1417\\n172\\t1\\t1417\\n175\\t1\\t1417\\n181\\t1\\t1417\\n182\\t1\\t1417\\n183\\t2\\t1417\\n184\\t3\\t1417\\n193\\t3\\t1417\\n195\\t2\\t1417\\n198\\t1\\t1417\\n199\\t1\\t1417\\n201\\t2\\t1417\\n203\\t2\\t1417\\n204\\t1\\t1417\\n205\\t1\\t1417\\n206\\t1\\t1417\\n207\\t1\\t1417\\n208\\t1\\t1417\\n210\\t1\\t1417\\n222\\t1\\t1417\\n225\\t1\\t1417\\n233\\t1\\t1417\\n267\\t3\\t1417\\n269\\t3\\t1417\\n280\\t1\\t1417\\n359\\t1\\t1417\\n360\\t1\\t1417\\n373\\t1\\t1417\\n382\\t1\\t1417\\n395\\t2\\t1417\\n415\\t1\\t1417\\n435\\t1\\t1417\\n458\\t1\\t1417\\n471\\t1\\t1417\\n481\\t1\\t1417\\n483\\t1\\t1417\\n485\\t1\\t1417\\n494\\t1\\t1417\\n515\\t1\\t1417\\n545\\t1\\t1417\\n552\\t1\\t1417\\n587\\t3\\t1417\\n605\\t1\\t1417\\n613\\t1\\t1417\\n614\\t1\\t1417\\n638\\t1\\t1417\\n667\\t1\\t1417\\n735\\t1\\t1417\\n747\\t1\\t1417\\n748\\t1\\t1417\\n750\\t2\\t1417\\n751\\t1\\t1417\\n753\\t1\\t1417\\n759\\t1\\t1417\\n760\\t1\\t1417\\n765\\t1\\t1417\\n766\\t1\\t1417\\n767\\t3\\t1417\\n774\\t1\\t1417\\n775\\t1\\t1417\\n778\\t2\\t1417\\n779\\t1\\t1417\\n780\\t1\\t1417\\n782\\t1\\t1417\\n784\\t1\\t1417\\n786\\t1\\t1417\\n787\\t1\\t1417\\n788\\t1\\t1417\\n789\\t1\\t1417\\n791\\t1\\t1417\\n792\\t2\\t1417\\n793\\t2\\t1417\\n800\\t2\\t1417\\n808\\t1\\t1417\\n823\\t1\\t1417\\n840\\t2\\t1417\\n891\\t1\\t1417\\n905\\t2\\t1417\\n907\\t1\\t1417\\n925\\t4\\t1417\\n948\\t1\\t1417\\n952\\t1\\t1417\\n953\\t2\\t1417\\n964\\t1\\t1417\\n968\\t1\\t1417\\n977\\t1\\t1417\\n981\\t1\\t1417\\n982\\t1\\t1417\\n983\\t2\\t1417\\n1009\\t1\\t1417\\n1016\\t1\\t1417\\n1018\\t1\\t1417\\n1019\\t3\\t1417\\n1023\\t1\\t1417\\n1030\\t1\\t1417\\n1055\\t1\\t1417\\n1081\\t1\\t1417\\n1082\\t2\\t1417\\n1083\\t1\\t1417\\n1085\\t1\\t1417\\n1086\\t1\\t1417\\n1087\\t1\\t1417\\n1090\\t1\\t1417\\n1135\\t1\\t1417\\n1184\\t1\\t1417\\n1187\\t1\\t1417\\n1201\\t1\\t1417\\n1203\\t1\\t1417\\n1219\\t3\\t1417\\n1240\\t1\\t1417\\n1260\\t1\\t1417\\n1268\\t1\\t1417\\n1275\\t1\\t1417\\n1276\\t1\\t1417\\n1278\\t2\\t1417\\n1280\\t1\\t1417\\n1285\\t1\\t1417\\n1286\\t1\\t1417\\n1287\\t1\\t1417\\n1302\\t1\\t1417\\n1324\\t1\\t1417\\n1335\\t1\\t1417\\n1358\\t1\\t1417\\n1359\\t1\\t1417\\n1390\\t1\\t1417\\n1397\\t2\\t1417\\n1400\\t1\\t1417\\n1401\\t2\\t1417\\n1402\\t1\\t1417\\n1410\\t1\\t1417\\n1416\\t3\\t1417\\n1417\\t13\\t1417\\n1418\\t3\\t1417\\n1426\\t1\\t1417\\n1428\\t1\\t1417\\n1432\\t1\\t1417\\n1450\\t1\\t1417\\n1450\\t1\\t1417\\n.I 1418\\n.T\\nJournal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library\\nSystems\\n.A\\nO\\'Neill, Edward True\\n.W\\n   Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research..\\nLibraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major\\nresponsibility for providing public access to the world\\'s literature.. Most\\nuniversities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized\\nlibraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This\\nuse of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally,\\nresulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. \\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this \\ndivision of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to \\nexamine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the \\nscattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. \\nThese results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library \\nsystems..\\n   Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually\\nestimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are\\ndeveloped.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its\\nadvantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made\\nrelative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can\\nbe defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can\\nserve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines..\\nThis framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and\\nalso for measuring the similarity between two disciplines..\\n   One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study\\nof journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title\\ndispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has \\nresulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford\\ndistribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various\\nsources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the\\nYule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered..\\n   The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and \\nevaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in \\ndetermining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding\\nadditional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and\\nbuilding mathematical models of library systems are among some of the\\napplications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity\\nfunctions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as\\na function of the number of subscriptions it receives..\\n   The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which\\nthe above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was \\ncollected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. \\ndissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete\\nrecords of the university\\'s scientific journal holdings were also obtained..\\nThe Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally\\nsatisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific\\ndisciplines is measured as is the similarity\\nbetween the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also\\nmeasured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system\\'s\\nholdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed \\nand evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions..\\n   This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts\\nas title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between \\ndisciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis\\nfor the design and evaluation of complete library systems..\\n.X\\n36\\t1\\t1418\\n48\\t1\\t1418\\n55\\t1\\t1418\\n57\\t1\\t1418\\n62\\t1\\t1418\\n167\\t1\\t1418\\n172\\t1\\t1418\\n184\\t1\\t1418\\n193\\t1\\t1418\\n195\\t1\\t1418\\n201\\t1\\t1418\\n203\\t1\\t1418\\n204\\t1\\t1418\\n205\\t1\\t1418\\n233\\t1\\t1418\\n267\\t1\\t1418\\n359\\t1\\t1418\\n360\\t1\\t1418\\n379\\t1\\t1418\\n395\\t1\\t1418\\n471\\t1\\t1418\\n587\\t1\\t1418\\n614\\t1\\t1418\\n635\\t1\\t1418\\n638\\t1\\t1418\\n667\\t1\\t1418\\n748\\t4\\t1418\\n750\\t1\\t1418\\n751\\t2\\t1418\\n753\\t1\\t1418\\n756\\t1\\t1418\\n757\\t1\\t1418\\n759\\t1\\t1418\\n765\\t1\\t1418\\n767\\t1\\t1418\\n778\\t3\\t1418\\n787\\t2\\t1418\\n791\\t1\\t1418\\n792\\t2\\t1418\\n793\\t1\\t1418\\n800\\t1\\t1418\\n804\\t1\\t1418\\n821\\t1\\t1418\\n831\\t1\\t1418\\n889\\t1\\t1418\\n907\\t1\\t1418\\n952\\t1\\t1418\\n953\\t1\\t1418\\n1081\\t1\\t1418\\n1082\\t2\\t1418\\n1083\\t2\\t1418\\n1085\\t3\\t1418\\n1086\\t1\\t1418\\n1182\\t1\\t1418\\n1201\\t1\\t1418\\n1210\\t1\\t1418\\n1219\\t2\\t1418\\n1254\\t1\\t1418\\n1256\\t1\\t1418\\n1260\\t1\\t1418\\n1268\\t1\\t1418\\n1275\\t1\\t1418\\n1278\\t2\\t1418\\n1302\\t1\\t1418\\n1369\\t1\\t1418\\n1373\\t1\\t1418\\n1401\\t1\\t1418\\n1417\\t3\\t1418\\n1418\\t7\\t1418\\n1426\\t1\\t1418\\n1426\\t1\\t1418\\n.I 1419\\n.T\\nUtility of Automatic Classification Systems for Information Storage and\\nRetrieval\\n.A\\nLitofsky, Barry\\n.W\\n   Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous \\nproblems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical of\\nthese problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, \\nstorage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems \\nis presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and \\nadvantages..\\n   The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori \\nautomatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is \\ndemonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document \\ndescriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by\\nestablishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and\\napplying these measures to a number of different classification strategies..\\nBy indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and \\none automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the \\nindexing method used..\\n   It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied,\\none particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In\\naddition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least\\nas good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as\\nthe a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the \\naforementioned file..\\n   The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a \\nfile of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included\\nas an appendix to this dissertation..\\n.X\\n45\\t1\\t1419\\n51\\t1\\t1419\\n62\\t1\\t1419\\n69\\t1\\t1419\\n71\\t1\\t1419\\n77\\t1\\t1419\\n79\\t1\\t1419\\n86\\t1\\t1419\\n168\\t1\\t1419\\n174\\t1\\t1419\\n175\\t2\\t1419\\n176\\t1\\t1419\\n310\\t2\\t1419\\n315\\t1\\t1419\\n318\\t1\\t1419\\n324\\t1\\t1419\\n363\\t1\\t1419\\n382\\t2\\t1419\\n389\\t1\\t1419\\n390\\t1\\t1419\\n409\\t1\\t1419\\n422\\t1\\t1419\\n448\\t1\\t1419\\n454\\t1\\t1419\\n462\\t1\\t1419\\n479\\t1\\t1419\\n480\\t1\\t1419\\n483\\t2\\t1419\\n484\\t1\\t1419\\n485\\t1\\t1419\\n486\\t1\\t1419\\n488\\t1\\t1419\\n491\\t1\\t1419\\n493\\t1\\t1419\\n503\\t1\\t1419\\n507\\t1\\t1419\\n509\\t1\\t1419\\n510\\t1\\t1419\\n512\\t1\\t1419\\n514\\t1\\t1419\\n517\\t1\\t1419\\n520\\t2\\t1419\\n522\\t1\\t1419\\n527\\t1\\t1419\\n528\\t1\\t1419\\n531\\t1\\t1419\\n564\\t1\\t1419\\n565\\t1\\t1419\\n566\\t1\\t1419\\n570\\t1\\t1419\\n576\\t1\\t1419\\n581\\t1\\t1419\\n586\\t1\\t1419\\n596\\t1\\t1419\\n603\\t1\\t1419\\n604\\t1\\t1419\\n608\\t2\\t1419\\n633\\t1\\t1419\\n636\\t1\\t1419\\n643\\t1\\t1419\\n659\\t2\\t1419\\n661\\t1\\t1419\\n662\\t1\\t1419\\n663\\t1\\t1419\\n678\\t1\\t1419\\n682\\t1\\t1419\\n715\\t1\\t1419\\n737\\t1\\t1419\\n754\\t1\\t1419\\n769\\t1\\t1419\\n790\\t1\\t1419\\n805\\t1\\t1419\\n809\\t1\\t1419\\n810\\t1\\t1419\\n812\\t1\\t1419\\n813\\t1\\t1419\\n814\\t1\\t1419\\n817\\t1\\t1419\\n820\\t1\\t1419\\n824\\t1\\t1419\\n825\\t1\\t1419\\n853\\t1\\t1419\\n875\\t1\\t1419\\n883\\t1\\t1419\\n894\\t2\\t1419\\n1051\\t1\\t1419\\n1274\\t1\\t1419\\n1294\\t1\\t1419\\n1313\\t1\\t1419\\n1327\\t3\\t1419\\n1419\\t7\\t1419\\n1427\\t1\\t1419\\n1427\\t1\\t1419\\n.I 1420\\n.T\\nTime-Lag in Cataloging\\n.A\\nPope, S.E.\\n.W\\n        Any who have the arduous task of assisting a student\\nthrough that ultimate of academic exercises, the preparation\\nand defense of a dissertation, are likely to define happiness\\nas a good book written by an advisee.

The procedures consider mostly only the interpretation\\nof texts, not the text itself as an object with recognizable marks\\nsubject to the laws of physics and the principles of engineering.\\nThey assume the problems of topic identification solved, and the\\nmethods for recovering physical texts as independent of the methods\\nfor describing the interpretations of texts.\\n.X\\n73\\t1\\t1422\\n134\\t1\\t1422\\n160\\t1\\t1422\\n233\\t1\\t1422\\n306\\t1\\t1422\\n474\\t1\\t1422\\n477\\t1\\t1422\\n558\\t1\\t1422\\n566\\t1\\t1422\\n600\\t1\\t1422\\n653\\t1\\t1422\\n665\\t2\\t1422\\n746\\t1\\t1422\\n748\\t1\\t1422\\n765\\t1\\t1422\\n780\\t1\\t1422\\n781\\t1\\t1422\\n785\\t1\\t1422\\n786\\t1\\t1422\\n789\\t1\\t1422\\n791\\t1\\t1422\\n795\\t1\\t1422\\n901\\t1\\t1422\\n1030\\t1\\t1422\\n1045\\t1\\t1422\\n1250\\t1\\t1422\\n1307\\t1\\t1422\\n1386\\t1\\t1422\\n1394\\t1\\t1422\\n1422\\t7\\t1422\\n1422\\t7\\t1422\\n.I 1423\\n.T\\nTraining for Library Service:  a report prepared for the\\nCarnegie Corporation of New York\\n.A\\nWilliamson, C.C.\\n.W\\n    The primary purpose in preparing the following report was\\nto present existing conditions in this country with respect to\\ntraining for library work in such a way that the educator and\\nthe layman interested in educational problems might be able to form\\na true conception of the steps that should be taken to improve this\\nphase of the library situation.\\n    The author has been obliged to limit the scope of his study to the\\nso-called professional schools.

As early as 1608,\\nwhen Thomas James was appointed to Bodley\\'s Library, \"he proposed the\\nestablishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student.  But\\nSir Thomas Bodley was opposed.\"  So it is to Harvard that we turn for an \\nexample of the protracted concern for the undergraduate\\'s plight.\\n    Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities and\\ntheir libraries were relatively small until this century.  More important,\\nthey were largely undergraduate institutions.  The great expansion of\\ngraduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon.  The problems of the\\nundergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by\\nthe striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis\\non the acquisition of materials suitable for research.\\n    The large university collections became increasingly difficult for the\\nundergraduate to use.  When he had to select his books from the card catalog\\nand obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might well\\nabandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out,\\nmissing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes.  The\\nuniversity library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - study\\nconditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the\\nvolume of work.\\n.X\\n262\\t1\\t1425\\n353\\t1\\t1425\\n365\\t1\\t1425\\n1068\\t1\\t1425\\n1203\\t1\\t1425\\n1211\\t1\\t1425\\n1212\\t1\\t1425\\n1266\\t1\\t1425\\n1425\\t5\\t1425\\n1425\\t5\\t1425\\n.I 1426\\n.T\\nUnderstanding Media: The Extensions of Man\\n.A\\nMcluhan, M\\n.W\\n  With the advent of individual detribalized man, a new\\neducation was needed.

New journals in specialized branches of \\nscience keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of \\nvolumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject \\nareas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for \\npublication.. The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the \\ndeveloping countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at\\na rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research \\nlibraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their\\nacquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests\\nof the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking \\nof periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective \\ncountries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field\\nof the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist..\\nThis method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries \\nby changing the citing journals according to their country\\'s needs..\\n.X\\n33\\t1\\t1432\\n36\\t1\\t1432\\n41\\t1\\t1432\\n76\\t1\\t1432\\n89\\t2\\t1432\\n97\\t1\\t1432\\n102\\t1\\t1432\\n111\\t1\\t1432\\n112\\t1\\t1432\\n163\\t1\\t1432\\n183\\t2\\t1432\\n184\\t2\\t1432\\n193\\t2\\t1432\\n198\\t1\\t1432\\n199\\t1\\t1432\\n201\\t1\\t1432\\n203\\t1\\t1432\\n204\\t1\\t1432\\n210\\t1\\t1432\\n225\\t1\\t1432\\n269\\t1\\t1432\\n360\\t3\\t1432\\n361\\t1\\t1432\\n373\\t1\\t1432\\n543\\t3\\t1432\\n545\\t1\\t1432\\n552\\t2\\t1432\\n587\\t1\\t1432\\n605\\t1\\t1432\\n613\\t1\\t1432\\n614\\t1\\t1432\\n638\\t1\\t1432\\n735\\t2\\t1432\\n747\\t1\\t1432\\n750\\t1\\t1432\\n753\\t1\\t1432\\n759\\t1\\t1432\\n766\\t2\\t1432\\n767\\t1\\t1432\\n775\\t2\\t1432\\n776\\t1\\t1432\\n782\\t1\\t1432\\n784\\t2\\t1432\\n788\\t1\\t1432\\n789\\t1\\t1432\\n793\\t1\\t1432\\n800\\t1\\t1432\\n808\\t1\\t1432\\n828\\t1\\t1432\\n905\\t1\\t1432\\n953\\t1\\t1432\\n977\\t1\\t1432\\n983\\t1\\t1432\\n1016\\t1\\t1432\\n1023\\t1\\t1432\\n1030\\t1\\t1432\\n1055\\t2\\t1432\\n1087\\t1\\t1432\\n1090\\t1\\t1432\\n1135\\t1\\t1432\\n1260\\t1\\t1432\\n1275\\t3\\t1432\\n1276\\t2\\t1432\\n1278\\t1\\t1432\\n1280\\t1\\t1432\\n1285\\t1\\t1432\\n1286\\t1\\t1432\\n1287\\t1\\t1432\\n1302\\t1\\t1432\\n1335\\t1\\t1432\\n1390\\t1\\t1432\\n1397\\t2\\t1432\\n1417\\t1\\t1432\\n1428\\t1\\t1432\\n1432\\t7\\t1432\\n1432\\t7\\t1432\\n.I 1433\\n.T\\nUniversal Bibliographical Control (UBC)\\n.A\\nKaltwasser, Franz Georg\\n.W\\n   The author outlines a plan for the systematic handling of bibliographical\\ndata from the time a book is printed anywhere in the world until its \\ncataloguing in the libraries..

This\\nbook is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such\\nit has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of\\nsolutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical\\nanalysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding\\nof the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.

It is tempting to say that it is a half a century overdue.  When\\nlibrarians first began to look beyond their national borders, bibliographic\\ncontrol was in the forefront of their concern.  Gradually, however, these\\npioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical\\nproblems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions\\nthe emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social\\nand even economic achievements of the international library community -\\nwhich was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of\\nnational efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others \\novergenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der \\nWiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception.\\n.X\\n92\\t1\\t1441\\n94\\t1\\t1441\\n121\\t1\\t1441\\n172\\t1\\t1441\\n235\\t1\\t1441\\n246\\t1\\t1441\\n247\\t1\\t1441\\n299\\t1\\t1441\\n326\\t1\\t1441\\n333\\t1\\t1441\\n361\\t1\\t1441\\n365\\t1\\t1441\\n434\\t1\\t1441\\n453\\t1\\t1441\\n530\\t1\\t1441\\n534\\t1\\t1441\\n541\\t1\\t1441\\n639\\t1\\t1441\\n652\\t1\\t1441\\n824\\t1\\t1441\\n825\\t2\\t1441\\n856\\t1\\t1441\\n872\\t1\\t1441\\n873\\t1\\t1441\\n874\\t1\\t1441\\n878\\t1\\t1441\\n880\\t1\\t1441\\n881\\t1\\t1441\\n886\\t1\\t1441\\n888\\t1\\t1441\\n913\\t1\\t1441\\n919\\t1\\t1441\\n920\\t1\\t1441\\n921\\t1\\t1441\\n939\\t1\\t1441\\n940\\t1\\t1441\\n941\\t1\\t1441\\n943\\t1\\t1441\\n947\\t1\\t1441\\n950\\t1\\t1441\\n963\\t1\\t1441\\n991\\t1\\t1441\\n996\\t1\\t1441\\n997\\t1\\t1441\\n1000\\t1\\t1441\\n1004\\t1\\t1441\\n1061\\t1\\t1441\\n1080\\t1\\t1441\\n1146\\t1\\t1441\\n1153\\t1\\t1441\\n1215\\t1\\t1441\\n1216\\t1\\t1441\\n1257\\t1\\t1441\\n1258\\t1\\t1441\\n1266\\t1\\t1441\\n1374\\t1\\t1441\\n1395\\t1\\t1441\\n1433\\t1\\t1441\\n1435\\t1\\t1441\\n1436\\t1\\t1441\\n1437\\t1\\t1441\\n1441\\t15\\t1441\\n1441\\t15\\t1441\\n.I 1442\\n.T\\nThe Universal Decimal Classification\\n.A\\nFoskett, A.C.\\n.W\\n  This study represents the result of some fifteen years of contact with\\nthe Universal Decimal Classification, as a user, as a reviser and as a\\nclassification teacher.

The long-term concern is the question\\nof how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that\\ncan be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-term\\nconcern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing card\\ncatalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user\\nrequirements.  It was recognized that a carefully designed study of actual\\nutilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light in\\nboth areas of concern.\\n.X\\n4\\t1\\t1445\\n9\\t1\\t1445\\n32\\t1\\t1445\\n57\\t1\\t1445\\n75\\t1\\t1445\\n96\\t1\\t1445\\n128\\t1\\t1445\\n132\\t1\\t1445\\n137\\t1\\t1445\\n163\\t1\\t1445\\n176\\t1\\t1445\\n207\\t1\\t1445\\n246\\t1\\t1445\\n265\\t1\\t1445\\n274\\t1\\t1445\\n276\\t1\\t1445\\n287\\t1\\t1445\\n329\\t1\\t1445\\n331\\t1\\t1445\\n348\\t1\\t1445\\n408\\t1\\t1445\\n456\\t1\\t1445\\n502\\t1\\t1445\\n554\\t1\\t1445\\n560\\t1\\t1445\\n565\\t1\\t1445\\n572\\t1\\t1445\\n584\\t1\\t1445\\n595\\t1\\t1445\\n596\\t1\\t1445\\n608\\t1\\t1445\\n619\\t1\\t1445\\n646\\t1\\t1445\\n647\\t1\\t1445\\n652\\t1\\t1445\\n654\\t1\\t1445\\n655\\t1\\t1445\\n768\\t1\\t1445\\n774\\t1\\t1445\\n783\\t3\\t1445\\n799\\t2\\t1445\\n810\\t1\\t1445\\n811\\t1\\t1445\\n812\\t1\\t1445\\n813\\t1\\t1445\\n814\\t1\\t1445\\n816\\t1\\t1445\\n823\\t1\\t1445\\n827\\t1\\t1445\\n851\\t1\\t1445\\n856\\t1\\t1445\\n857\\t1\\t1445\\n858\\t1\\t1445\\n859\\t1\\t1445\\n860\\t1\\t1445\\n861\\t1\\t1445\\n862\\t1\\t1445\\n870\\t1\\t1445\\n888\\t1\\t1445\\n894\\t1\\t1445\\n913\\t1\\t1445\\n919\\t2\\t1445\\n920\\t1\\t1445\\n922\\t1\\t1445\\n928\\t1\\t1445\\n961\\t1\\t1445\\n962\\t1\\t1445\\n963\\t1\\t1445\\n964\\t1\\t1445\\n968\\t1\\t1445\\n970\\t1\\t1445\\n990\\t1\\t1445\\n991\\t1\\t1445\\n1003\\t1\\t1445\\n1012\\t1\\t1445\\n1013\\t1\\t1445\\n1035\\t1\\t1445\\n1068\\t1\\t1445\\n1203\\t1\\t1445\\n1255\\t1\\t1445\\n1291\\t1\\t1445\\n1315\\t1\\t1445\\n1321\\t1\\t1445\\n1340\\t1\\t1445\\n1395\\t1\\t1445\\n1407\\t1\\t1445\\n1413\\t1\\t1445\\n1445\\t10\\t1445\\n1445\\t10\\t1445\\n.I 1446\\n.T\\nDistill or Drown:  The Need for Reviews\\n.A\\nHerring, C.\\n.W\\n  The information explosion sparks a need\\nfor creative synthesis of facts and ideas.\\nFor efficient access to good scientific\\nliterature we must devise new schemes for\\ncompression.\\n.X\\n37\\t1\\t1446\\n63\\t2\\t1446\\n132\\t1\\t1446\\n161\\t1\\t1446\\n166\\t1\\t1446\\n386\\t1\\t1446\\n398\\t1\\t1446\\n771\\t1\\t1446\\n907\\t1\\t1446\\n1095\\t1\\t1446\\n1102\\t1\\t1446\\n1103\\t1\\t1446\\n1107\\t1\\t1446\\n1110\\t1\\t1446\\n1111\\t1\\t1446\\n1113\\t1\\t1446\\n1115\\t2\\t1446\\n1142\\t2\\t1446\\n1160\\t1\\t1446\\n1177\\t1\\t1446\\n1181\\t1\\t1446\\n1284\\t1\\t1446\\n1446\\t7\\t1446\\n1447\\t4\\t1446\\n1447\\t4\\t1446\\n.I 1447\\n.T\\nInformation, Communication, Knowledge\\n.A\\nZiman, J.M.\\n.W\\n  At the British Association meeting in Exeter last month,\\nProfessor Ziman addressed the section devoted to general\\ntopics on the question of how scientific information becomes\\npublic knowledge.

This volume is primarily concerned with the government-\\nbusiness relationships within which these activities take place.\\nOur title reflects our emphasis.  Weapons Acquisition is defined to\\ninclude the conception, development, and production of technically\\nadvanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Process\\nemphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weapons\\nprograms, including the actions, reactions, and interactions of\\ngovernment agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicates\\nour concern with how these activities and relationships affect the\\nquality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs.\\n  The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge of\\nthese facets of weapons development and production.  Such an\\nobjective classified the volume as a social science, rather than\\nadministrative study.  Yet most social science research, \\nhowever \"pure\" the form, is ultimately directed at changing public\\npolicy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with a\\nspecific set of public policy recommendations.

However, it became apparent that the principles\\nand techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library \\ncollections.\\n    This work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes:\\n    1. As a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion, knowledge, and\\nserious research in the field of weeding.  The author\\'s own research is \\nreported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  In\\naddition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study.\\n    2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their\\npresent collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain and\\njustify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for \"weeding\\nwithout tears.\"\\n    3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal with\\nthe acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one \\nof the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful \\ncollections.\\n    4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped that\\nlibraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs\\nof weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of\\ncirculation and in user satisfaction.\\n.X\\n46\\t1\\t1450\\n115\\t1\\t1450\\n234\\t1\\t1450\\n304\\t1\\t1450\\n306\\t1\\t1450\\n338\\t1\\t1450\\n646\\t1\\t1450\\n647\\t1\\t1450\\n651\\t1\\t1450\\n942\\t1\\t1450\\n943\\t2\\t1450\\n944\\t1\\t1450\\n948\\t1\\t1450\\n983\\t1\\t1450\\n1017\\t1\\t1450\\n1021\\t1\\t1450\\n1023\\t1\\t1450\\n1049\\t1\\t1450\\n1203\\t1\\t1450\\n1206\\t1\\t1450\\n1237\\t1\\t1450\\n1378\\t1\\t1450\\n1417\\t1\\t1450\\n1440\\t1\\t1450\\n1450\\t9\\t1450\\n1453\\t1\\t1450\\n1453\\t1\\t1450\\n.I 1451\\n.T\\nSome Behavioral Patterns of Library Users:  The 80/20 rule\\n.A\\nTrueswell, R.L. \\n.W\\n  A characteristic of inventory in business or industry\\nis that approximately 80 percent of the number of\\ntransactions taken from a warehouse represents about\\n20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also be\\nconsidered as a ranking of stock items by their\\ntransaction activity which will show that the top 20\\npercent of the stocked items (i.e., the most active\\nitems) account for about 80 percent of the total\\nnumber of transactions.  The rule is sometimes\\nexpressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation.\\nIt is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100\\nas the phenomena relate to the relationships between\\nthe two statistical measures.\\n.X\\n2\\t1\\t1451\\n24\\t1\\t1451\\n31\\t1\\t1451\\n74\\t1\\t1451\\n75\\t1\\t1451\\n76\\t1\\t1451\\n111\\t1\\t1451\\n119\\t1\\t1451\\n122\\t1\\t1451\\n132\\t1\\t1451\\n137\\t1\\t1451\\n139\\t1\\t1451\\n152\\t1\\t1451\\n155\\t1\\t1451\\n183\\t2\\t1451\\n193\\t1\\t1451\\n195\\t1\\t1451\\n201\\t1\\t1451\\n203\\t1\\t1451\\n204\\t1\\t1451\\n210\\t1\\t1451\\n269\\t1\\t1451\\n336\\t1\\t1451\\n475\\t1\\t1451\\n552\\t1\\t1451\\n684\\t1\\t1451\\n760\\t1\\t1451\\n767\\t1\\t1451\\n774\\t1\\t1451\\n775\\t1\\t1451\\n778\\t1\\t1451\\n788\\t2\\t1451\\n789\\t2\\t1451\\n955\\t1\\t1451\\n961\\t1\\t1451\\n977\\t2\\t1451\\n1011\\t1\\t1451\\n1055\\t1\\t1451\\n1056\\t1\\t1451\\n1203\\t1\\t1451\\n1275\\t1\\t1451\\n1352\\t1\\t1451\\n1451\\t6\\t1451\\n1451\\t6\\t1451\\n.I 1452\\n.T\\nThe Wiswesser Line-Formula Chemical Notation (WLN)\\n.A\\nSmith, E.G.\\n.W\\n    The line-formula chemical notation described in this manual\\nis a precise and concise means of expressing the structural\\nformulas of chemical compounds.  Its basic idea is to use\\nletter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbers\\nto express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings.\\nThese symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end of\\nthe molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, ever\\nsince structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphic\\nsymbols in this way.

There are local library groups\\nwhich are examining the status of women in their own libraries and\\norganizing to improve their employment situations.

I was impressed by\\nthe large amount of research being conducted in the field, but found\\nthe task of integrating that research and of identifying the progress\\nmade during the period of the review exceedingly difficult.  In part,\\nthis difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators\\nin the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used\\nto study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparent\\ntheoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to be\\nhighly specific and inadequately defined.  There was little standardization\\nof terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processes\\nunderlying empirical data.\\n.X\\n270\\t1\\t1454\\n285\\t2\\t1454\\n296\\t1\\t1454\\n301\\t2\\t1454\\n302\\t1\\t1454\\n418\\t1\\t1454\\n925\\t1\\t1454\\n1015\\t3\\t1454\\n1048\\t1\\t1454\\n1065\\t1\\t1454\\n1069\\t1\\t1454\\n1070\\t1\\t1454\\n1150\\t2\\t1454\\n1214\\t1\\t1454\\n1321\\t1\\t1454\\n1454\\t6\\t1454\\n1455\\t1\\t1454\\n1455\\t1\\t1454\\n.I 1455\\n.T\\nWork and the Nature of Man\\n.A\\nHerzberg, F.\\n.W\\n  Work and the Nature of Man is the third book of a\\ntrilogy concerning job attitudes.  In the first book,\\nJob Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion, my\\ncolleagues and I attempted to review and systematize\\nwhat had been gleaned from research and contemplation\\nafter a half-century of effort.  In the Motivation to\\nWork that followed, we described an original research\\nstudy that offered a completely new hypothesis about the\\nway people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I have\\ntaken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theory\\nof Work and the Nature of Man.\\tWhile the trilogy contains\\nthe three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledge\\nof what has gone before, new research and finally a\\ntheory, the task that I set out for myself many years\\nago, upon graduation for the School of Public Health\\nat the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning.  \\nThat task was to give original substance to the new \\ndiscipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible,\\nto make some positive contributions.\\n.X\\n418\\t3\\t1455\\n1041\\t1\\t1455\\n1069\\t1\\t1455\\n1070\\t2\\t1455\\n1150\\t1\\t1455\\n1233\\t2\\t1455\\n1454\\t1\\t1455\\n1455\\t5\\t1455\\n1455\\t5\\t1455\\n.I 1456\\n.T\\nWorld Dynamics\\n.A\\nForrester, J.W.\\n.W\\n  Over the last several decades interest in economic development,\\npopulation growth, and the world environment has expanded rapidly.\\nAs world-wide stresses have increased, many individuals and \\norganizations have begun to study and to influence the changing\\naspects of the world situation.  But it seems fair to observe\\nthat most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets\\nof the world system.  Little has yet been done to show how the many\\nactions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total\\nconsequences that we observe.  Now however, many persons are coming\\nto believe that the interactions within the whole are more important\\nthan the sum of the separate parts.  This book was undertaken as one\\nstep toward showing how the behavior of the world system results from\\nmutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agricultural\\nsubsystems.\\n.X\\n350\\t1\\t1456\\n435\\t1\\t1456\\n1025\\t1\\t1456\\n1402\\t1\\t1456\\n1456\\t6\\t1456\\n1456\\t6\\t1456\\n.I 1457\\n.T\\nWorld Trends in Library Education\\n.A\\nBramley, G.\\n.W\\n  One of the most significant aspects of the evolution of\\nlibrarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence \\nof the library schools as a potent factor in shaping new\\nphilosophies and new attitudes in the library profession.  The\\nintention of the present work is to examine some of the\\nimplications of this rapid growth in the number of library\\nschools, noting current trends and possible changes in the\\nfuture.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed,\\nand there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo-\\nAmerican library education, while at the same time examining\\nother major patterns of professional education for librarians\\nwhich exist in the world, and comparing these with the\\napproach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt has\\nbeen made to trace the influences which the British and\\nAmerica systems of library education have had, particularly\\nin the developing countries.\\n.X\\n128\\t1\\t1457\\n130\\t1\\t1457\\n191\\t1\\t1457\\n339\\t1\\t1457\\n370\\t1\\t1457\\n376\\t1\\t1457\\n387\\t1\\t1457\\n453\\t1\\t1457\\n629\\t1\\t1457\\n648\\t1\\t1457\\n652\\t1\\t1457\\n1376\\t1\\t1457\\n1403\\t1\\t1457\\n1457\\t5\\t1457\\n1457\\t5\\t1457\\n.I 1458\\n.T\\nLegal Restrictions on Exploitation of the Patent Monopoly:\\nAn Economic Analysis\\n.A\\nBaxter, W.A.\\n.W\\n  The patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all others\\nfrom making, using or selling his invention.  In furtherance of a\\nconstitutionally recognized goal - \"To promote the Progress of\\nScience and the useful Arts\" - Congress has thus adopted a \\nconstitutionally authorized means - \"securing...to Inventors\\nthe exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries.\"  The\\nconstitutional clause is remarkable in several respects.  Its\\nrecognition of the possibility that invention might require\\nencouragement implies not only that technological innovation is\\ndesirable but also that, but for legal subsidization, the quantity\\nof innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum.\\nThis recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which the\\ntendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities\\nwas greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiry\\ninto the soundness of the supposition.\\n.X\\n1458\\t5\\t1458\\n1458\\t5\\t1458\\n.I 1459\\n.T\\nLanguage and Thought\\n.A\\nPoluskin, V.A.\\n.W\\nThis book considers the basic aspects of this complex problem - the historical\\nand social essence of language and thought, their interaction in historical\\nevolution, the essence of linguistic meaning in relation to the content side\\nof thought, and the physiological mechanism of the processes of abstraction,\\ngeneralization, etc.\\n.X\\n362\\t1\\t1459\\n585\\t1\\t1459\\n1093\\t1\\t1459\\n1107\\t1\\t1459\\n1138\\t1\\t1459\\n1141\\t1\\t1459\\n1169\\t2\\t1459\\n1459\\t5\\t1459\\n1459\\t5\\t1459\\n.I 1460\\n.T\\nModern Integral Information Systems for Chemistry and Chemical Technology\\n.A\\nChernyi, A.I.\\n.W\\n  At the present time, about 15% of all the world publications of \\nscientific and technical literature relate to chemistry and chemical\\ntechnology.
